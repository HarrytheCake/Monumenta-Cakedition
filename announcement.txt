&bMerry Christmas from Team Monumenta!&r
Merry Christmas, everyone • 'tis the season of remembrance.
While many may be prepping for the holidays and new year ahead
of us, I think it's important for us to reflect on the journey
that we all went through this year. So as always, come join me
as we walk back through what 2023 brought to this game and
community.
In January, hot off the heels of Region 3's launch late last
year, the community was presented with an awesome new sandbox to
work with • our open Item API, and with it, one of the most
important community tools in recent memory, ohthemisery.tk! This
spectacular addition to the community has revolutionized the way
we view, share, and discuss items for a game with an ever
increasing amount, and we are all the better for it.
Delves have long been something that grew and expanded well
beyond the vision of their original creator, with more and more
modifiers being added on to it over the years. With February, we
saw the overhaul of the delves experience with the addition of
Challenge Delves! These hand-picked experiences combine the
chaos of 50 point delves with modifiers best suited for the
dungeon at hand, allowing for unique ways to experience the
dungeon and claim your Trophy. And of course max point delves
are still there for those of you brave and/or foolish enough....
Speaking of dungeons, entering March we saw the launch of a
brand new type of dungeon experience • Exalted Dungeons!
Launching a whopping 4 exalteds over the course of a few weeks,
you could now experience White, Orange, Magenta, and Light Blue
as fully realized Region 3 dungeons, complete with mob and
difficulty overhauls that brought them up to snuff with your
endgame R3 gear. And with the promise of more to come, Exalteds
stand as a wonderful expansion onto our latest region!April took
a bit of a break from content as we focused on some upcoming
launches, but it wasn't without its highlights, especially in
the systems department. This month saw several pieces of
content, most notably our strikes, transition to being instanced
out of the overworlds. This was a huge leap forward for our
server load and infrastructure, as it freed up shard space for
more needed content. And with some systems in the works as we
speak, you can expect more of these transitions to be seen
heading into 2024!
May was an explosive month for us, seeing not only the expansion
of Yellow and Willows into the Exalted system, but also a type
of update the game has not seen in nearly 6 years • the addition
of a brand new class, Shaman! This class focuses heavily on
controlling your area and managing your totems to best optimize
your combat experience, offering a type of playstyle different
to anything the game had offered prior. And with the constant
feedback loop given by you all, this class was fine tuned into
something truly special!
In June, we return back to dungeons once again for the overhaul
of yet another system • the re-introduction of Dungeon Races as
an official game mode! Gone are the days of one attempt a week,
having to waste your instance. You can now hammer out
leaderboard times to your heart's content, optmizing your routes
and striving for that #1 slot for fun, glory, and the most
important reward of all, bragging rights!In October, we return
again to Shaman, with the second batch of the class' release.
After several months of constant feedback and design concepting,
the class was finally incorporated into Region 3's ecosystem,
complete with charms and enhancements. At last, we could finally
call Monumenta's 8th class fully realized, and you could play it
without hesistation in the Architect's Ring!
November saw a finale of sorts to a system we've alluded to a
couple times now, rounding out the Region 1 exalted dungeon set
with the release of the Exalted Malevolent Reverie! Return once
again to the nightmare, and take down these waves of fully
redesigned R3 mobs, complete with a fully overhauled Axtal
bossfight! Keep your eyes peeled though, because many new
secrets lie below the surface of this dream within a dream...
Finally, we have reached December, a month that should need no
introduction. Wrapping up the year, we saw the launch of the
first expansion to the Architect's Ring, Star Point. So far, you
have seen the release of the new overworld island, complete with
6 brand new POIs and several quests, as well as our latest
dungeon, the Celestial Zenith • the successor to the Darkest
Depths. That's not all that lies in store for the Serebrium
Citadel though, as much more is on it's way in the coming weeks
and months!
And there we have it, a trip back through 2023! The game has
changed so drastically in the past year, and we didn't even
mention smaller, but still incredibly important updates like the
Seasonal Passes, the Forsworn Sanctum enhancements, the
Alchemist rework, Mechanical Armory, boat races, website
upgrades, the Trade GUI, dungeon music, and so much more! This
has been a wonderful year for the game, and I hope 2024 brings
us just as much, if not more, to behold.
So with that, from all of us here at Team Monumenta • Merry
Christmas, and Happy New Year!July takes us all the way back to
the early game experience. Some of the game's earliest quests
have always been daunting • having vague information and
directions given, outdated mechanics, and overall were seen as
an unfun slog to the first dungeon. This month saw the complete
overhaul of several of the beginner level quests, including
Mage's Legacy, Crown of Topaz/Majesty, Supply and Demand, and Of
Monks and Magic. These weren't just small tweaks, but full
scale, ground-up remakes designed to enhance the new game
experience and bring questing in this segment of the game up to
modern standards. A few POIs even got some awesome rebuilds in
the process, including the Axtan Monastery, the most quest-
visited POI in R1!
Keeping Monumenta up to date with Minecraft's additions over the
years has always been something the dev team has strived for and
believed in, not wanting the server to fall several updates
behind ||(like some servers I won't name)||. As such, August saw
us enter an upgrade period to bring the game up to 1.19! This
requires us to take several weeks focusing on critical issues
that each update brings (thanks Mojang), but is always well
worth it in the end. Here's looking forward to 1.20 in 2024!
Coming out of the 1.19 upgrade in September, our first major
update came in the form of Marina Noir, the second map to the
Gallery of Fear! In this spiritual successor to the Malevolent
Reverie, you return to a place very familiar to you, yet somehow
very different. We took several steps to incorporate feedback
from Gallery's first map into Marina's fundamental design, and,
with some unrelated memory leak issues notwithstanding, this map
has proven to be a much welcome boon to the Gallery ecosystem!
&bA&rnother time, another place
&bW&raiting to see you, face to face
&bA&rnother hour, I don’t know when
&bL&ronging ‘til we can speak again
&bT&rime ticks by, wholely unaware
&bE&rver mindless that you aren’t there
&bR&rivers that flow, from eyes to jaw
&bS&rpeak of our story, our laughs like law
&bK&rind, and warm, and gentle of soul
&bO&rur words but fail to paint you whole
&bN&row our paths split, divergence begotten
&bG&rone you may be, but never forgotten
Remembering our dear friend and co-developer, Awalterskong, one
year following his passing. We miss you, buddy.Thank you to
everyone who came out to play the launch of our new dungeon,
Celestial Zenith!
We have some fun data to share from the first week of play, put
together by the amazing @panderz14. This information gives us
valuable insight into how players are performing and helps us
keep the game balanced for the future.
We are blown away by the incredible reception to this content
and it clearly shows us it deserves more support and features in
the future. Stay tuned for our 2024 content roadmap!
&b2024 Monumenta Roadmap&r
It's been an amazing 2023 for Monumenta, and as with previous
years it's time to share a glimpse of what the development team
has sights on for 2024! This will cover a wide range of areas
from new content to infrastructure improvements, and with
release dates from anytime next month until the end of the year.
Let's start with the carryover from the last roadmap that we
didn't quite have ready in 2023 but should be available soonTM
in the first part of next year:
• We have two different content features nearing completion for
enhancing R3's overworld replayability, focused on quick, bite
size content that works well solo or with a large team!
• After some on and off development throughout 2023, the market
plugin is still in progress and being actively worked on. We are
hoping to have more to share about this publicly soon,
especially to our Patrons!
And now for some new stuff we haven't talked about before:
• We’ll be returning to Star Point again next year to continue
your adventures. We’re excited to say we have a full scale
traditional dungeon currently in development, alongside
additional overworld content, new quests, and even more
surprises.
• Furthermore, we'll continue supporting the ever replayable
Celestial Zenith dungeon with more ascensions and features!• We
aren't actively working on the next biome expansion for the
Architect's Ring yet, but early next year we will finalize our
direction for what that will be, with the goal once again to
ship something significant by the end of 2024.
• Several new quests for the Celsian Isles are in development to
continue and complete old storylines, as well as new quests for
the Architect's Ring to continue to expand its world.
• Exalted dungeons will continue bridging major content releases
next year, kicking off the R2 dungeons. The first batch of these
is still a ways out, but we look forward to continue modernizing
these popular dungeons with all of the new R3 gameplay options
available to us• time has flown by but we'll be celebrating the
5th birthday of the Celsian Isles in 2024!
• The devious designers behind Silver Knight's Tomb are working
on another multiplayer boss raid, with several challenging
teamwork-based encounters planned.
• We're working on an extremely unique piece of passive content
that serves to give incentive to interact with the game more
frequently.
• We'll be updating to 1.20 at some point next year, enabling us
to use the new blocks and gameplay features in our next
expansion.
• Finally, our next infrastructure technology goal is enabling
multiple different dungeons to run on the same shard. This will
significantly reduce our server costs and provide a large step
towards enabling servers in different locations around the
world!
That's all we have to share for now, but like Shaman this year,
you can always expect some surprises! Happy New Year from Team
Monumenta and we wish you all the best for 2024!
