Monumenta #announcements
A while ago, we moved the [Official Monumenta
Wiki](https://monumenta.wiki.gg/wiki/Monumenta_Wiki) from Fandom
to wiki.gg. Unfortunately, because of Fandom’s rules, we cannot
remove the wiki nor link to the new one; Fandom will consider
edits of this sort vandalism and revert them. In order for
wiki.gg to appear as the first Google search result, we advise
not visiting the Fandom wiki at all, even for purposes of
vandalism/linking to wiki.gg. Thank you to all players who have
contributed to the wiki!
**Exalted Dungeons, Batch 4: Malevolent Reverie!**  Very happy
to announce that the finale of the R1 Exalted dungeon line is on
its way, the Exalted Malevolent Reverie! The mob and balance
team has been working extremely diligently over the course of
the past few months to ensure that this milestone for Exalteds
lives up to its expectations, and we're excited for you to
finally get your hands on it.  Keep on guard and your eyes
peeled, because you never know what may have changed as you
delve back into the nightmare of the Exalted Reverie, arriving
next weekend at our usual launch window, <t:1699722000:F>!  We
hope to see you all there! @everyone   ||P■■as■ ■■ve■tu■e■, ■

Please do not pick Vengeful in Exalted Reverie **as of now**, as
some mobs break due to the modifier.
