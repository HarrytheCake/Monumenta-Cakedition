were unable to prepare changes in time for our testing team to
have adequate time to give feedback and find issues. Going

delaying future balance updates and make adequate room for
testing. We once again thank you for your patience and

finally arrived! As the culmination of your adventure throughout
Star Point, the time has come to break the seal to Phyrrys and

Remains&r, and completion of any level of &oCelestial Zenith&r ‚Ä¢
the quest will be progressable up until the point that you

into this dungeon and everything surrounding it, and we can't
wait for you all to enjoy! @everyone
