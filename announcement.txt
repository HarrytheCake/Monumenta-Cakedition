&bHappy New Year Monumenta!&r
We'd like to kick it off by updating you all on the status of
our upgrade to 1.20.4.
Currently, the upgrade has been completed on an internal clone
of Monumenta that we call the "stage" server, where we are
currently testing anything and everything we can think of that
might have issues with the new version, and fixing as we go. We
can't promise any particular date when this is done because we
don't yet know everything that needs fixing and what works
perfectly. Below is snippet of our testing log channel as a peak
behind the curtain.
Provided we don't find anything catastrophic, this should be our
final step before we end our feature freeze and push the upgrade
to Monumenta itself!
Thank you all for your patience with us these last couple
months! Please look forward to the awesome stuff we have in
store for you in 2025!
&b1.20.4 Upgrade Plans&r
After months of development and several rounds of beta testing
completed, we plan to perform the server upgrade to version
1.20.4 <t:1737925200:R>, roughly at <t:1737925200:F>.
We heavily encourage you to finish up any open dungeon instances
as soon as possible, as they may become broken or otherwise
impossible to complete following the version upgrade. Estimated
downtime for the update is anywhere between 4 to 8 hours. After
this, we will resume our usual weekly update schedule. As usual,
report any new bugs to # bug-reports and we will fix them as
soon as we can.
As a note, this time is flexible, and may be pushed back
depending on any unforseen issues that may occur between now and
then.
@everyone
As an additional note: Due to slow progress over the holidays
and a desire to launch the next balance update with as few
issues as possible, we are not launching a balance patch with
the 1.20.4 update. Instead, the next patch is planned to ship on
February 6th. The bulk of the update will be focused on
addressing issues with Scout and Cleric. Until then, feel free
to bring your balance concerns to https://discord.com/channels/3

initiative to make it happen (with the team's help, of course üôÇ
)
‚Ä¢ Willingness to learn systems unique to Monumenta when
relevant.
‚Ä¢ Basic proficiency in English.
&bPreferred/Optional&r

&b[APPLY HERE](https://forms.gle/GpvFvpNVGKSNjFCP8)&rThe weekly
update has been moved to <t:1738814400:F> due to internal
scheduling reasons. This month's balance update is delayed and
will be shipping next week.
This will
&bnot&r impact your instances, since those are tied to the
weekly reset.
