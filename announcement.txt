Another addition to Monumenta in 2024 that we have yet to
discuss was the introduction early in the year of Item
Discoveries. These often small and hidden interactions serve as
a way to promote exploration throughout the game, rewarding
players for searching every nook and cranny across Monumenta's
world. That said, nothing quite encapsulates the sheer potential
of item discoveries as a framework for storytelling and
community cooperation as what came in October, the release of
the Smallpoint discovery! In this region-crossing adventure, you
experience a tale unlike anything Monumenta has ever told ‚Ä¢ one
I can hardly speak on lest I spoil you, but also one that sets
the bar for stories to come!
And finally, we reach November and December. It has been a long
standing belief of the dev team that the best way to keep
Monumenta relevant in the years to come is to stay as updated to
Minecraft's versions as possible. As such, in these months we
have placed a pause on content releases as we spend time
upgrading to the server to 1.20.4! This as usual has been a
lengthy process, filled with strange bugs and backend changes,
but rest assured that we remain hard at work to bring Monumenta
back to our regular release schedule, and are spending the
downtime wrapping out several pieces of content to come in the
early days of 2025!
And there we have it, Monumenta's 2024 in a not-so-brief
nutshell, and we didn't even discuss more minor releases such as
the Teal mechanical overhaul, ability hotbars, the
warlock/reaper revamps, enchantopedia, grave poses, the mail
system, and so much more! While the year certainly had less
massive content drops than we typically see, it is still in many
ways starkly different than it was just a year ago, and we're
all excited to see the year ahead as 2025 shapes up to be a
great time for us!
So with that, from all of here at Team Monumenta, we wish you
all a Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year!One last new developer
for 2024 ‚Ä¢ please congratulate @TheAz1 for promotion to full dev
for being instrumental in the development of the Creeperjuice
quest and several other things not quite out yet!
&bHappy New Year Monumenta!&r
We'd like to kick it off by updating you all on the status of
our upgrade to 1.20.4.
Currently, the upgrade has been completed on an internal clone
of Monumenta that we call the "stage" server, where we are
currently testing anything and everything we can think of that
might have issues with the new version, and fixing as we go. We
can't promise any particular date when this is done because we
don't yet know everything that needs fixing and what works
perfectly. Below is snippet of our testing log channel as a peak
behind the curtain.
Provided we don't find anything catastrophic, this should be our
final step before we end our feature freeze and push the upgrade
to Monumenta itself!
Thank you all for your patience with us these last couple
months! Please look forward to the awesome stuff we have in
store for you in 2025!
&b1.20.4 Upgrade Plans&r
After months of development and several rounds of beta testing
completed, we plan to perform the server upgrade to version
1.20.4 <t:1737925200:R>, roughly at <t:1737925200:F>.
We heavily encourage you to finish up any open dungeon instances
as soon as possible, as they may become broken or otherwise
impossible to complete following the version upgrade. Estimated
downtime for the update is anywhere between 4 to 8 hours. After
this, we will resume our usual weekly update schedule. As usual,
report any new bugs to # bug-reports and we will fix them as
soon as we can.
As a note, this time is flexible, and may be pushed back
depending on any unforseen issues that may occur between now and
then.
@everyone
As an additional note: Due to slow progress over the holidays
and a desire to launch the next balance update with as few
issues as possible, we are not launching a balance patch with
the 1.20.4 update. Instead, the next patch is planned to ship on
February 6th. The bulk of the update will be focused on
addressing issues with Scout and Cleric. Until then, feel free
to bring your balance concerns to https://discord.com/channels/3
