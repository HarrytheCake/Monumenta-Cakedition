&bOpen Call for Building Developer Applications:&r
Hey all, we're putting out this call for anyone that is
interested in joining TM as a Builder. Building is one of the
largest bottlenecks for releasing new content, and we're hoping
to grow our rosters so that we can release high quality content
more often.
&nTo apply, we ask that you:&r
‚Ä¢ Can work collaboratively with other builders and parts of the
team
‚Ä¢ Can create unique gameplay spaces and visual themes
‚Ä¢ Can take feedback & constructive criticism from your peers
‚Ä¢ Have basic familiarity with build tools such as FAWE (World
Edit), FAVS (VoxelSniper), or Axiom
A key factor to success as a builder is your ability to self
motivate. We're looking for people not only with a knack for
building but also those who can see their builds through to
completion in a timely manner.
If you feel you may not have sufficient skill with building, but
have experience with gameplay/level design and a willingness to
learn building, we would also like to consider your application.
Having played through most Monumenta content is a great boon as
to familiarize yourself with our level style.
For those interested in applying, please fill out the Monumenta
Developer Application form here:
https://forms.gle/GpvFvpNVGKSNjFCP8.
&bPlease provide a showcase/portfolio of your work for us to get
an idea of your build skills, either linked in the application
itself, or DM'd to Aristotle.&r Solo builds are preferred, but
if any of it was done with other people, please make it clear
what part of it was your work.Hello everyone! We‚Äôre thrilled to
announce the next piece of Monumenta Raid content coming to the
server:
&bHexfall&r!
The spiritual successor to Silver Knight‚Äôs Tomb, Hexfall
features the finale of the story of Hycenea and Harrakfar, the
Blue Wool. This raid will pit you against two fearsome new raid
bosses posing threats not seen before in Monumenta.  Hexfall
features some of the most mechanically complex fights to date
that will test the limits of you and your party. You'll find
unique, gameplay-altering patterns throughout each fight that
will test your problem-solving capabilities and reflexes. This
raid emphasizes mechanical difficulty, and will require
progression more akin to a traditional MMO raid tier.
We‚Äôre incredibly excited for you all to take on the challenges
that lie in wait in Hexfall at the beginning of September!
&bPUPPET, HOW YOU WANDER WEAKLY
KNOWING NAUGHT OF WHOM YOU SERVE
MEAGER CHILD, RAISING FEEBLY
STEEL AGAINST OUR IRON NERVE
FOR I AM LIFE, AND YOURS I‚ÄôVE WATCHED.
YOUR VILE DEEDS CORRUPT AND REND
GREAT EMPERORS AND KINGS AND GODS
YOU‚ÄôVE FELLED, YET HERE YOU‚ÄôLL MEET YOUR END&rHey @everyone !
I'm happy to announce that Hexfall, our brand new 4-player raid
content, will be releasing on
&b<t:1725724800:F>&r!  Alongside Hexfall, with our next patch on
Thursday a new prelude quest "Bad Moon Rising" will be releasing
covering the events leading up to the raid. This raid is easily
the hardest and most mechanically challenging piece of content
the server has yet seen and will be a monumental hurdle for even
the most experienced teams, so be prepared! We're beyond excited
to watch you all tackle this content and hope you'll enjoy
playing it as much as we enjoyed making it.

&bNew Zenith Charm Auction Bot:&r
Hey everyone,
A new bot @Monumenta Charms Bot, is here to manage Zenith charm
auctions! Simply head to <#313066655494438922> and get the
@Zenith Auctions role, then head to <#1249243796701577298> and
run /help for a basic command list, and explanations on what
each command does.
The previous system of manually creating and typing in bids has
caused moderation issues and has made it hard to find the charms
you are looking for. The new bot aims to solve these issues by
having standardized rules and search features.
The currently active Auctions Thread will remain open for the
time being, but all new charm auctions should be moved over to
the bot.
If you have found any bugs, please message @pe.li. Expect the
bot to be down sometimes for the first week until it is fully
stabilized.Hey @everyone , just a reminder that 49 minutes from
this message, our new raid
&bHexfall&r will be releasing!
Form up a team of 4 and be ready for some of the hardest
challenges the game has to offer. We hope you all have as much
fun playing as we did making it!
Good luck everyone!We have a hotfix coming in for Hexfall in
around an hour. At that time we will be breifly restarting the
server so these changes can take effect.We have a second hotfix
coming in 20 mins aimed at improving Ru'Ten significantly with
some changes to Hycenea as well. Thank you very much for your
patience today, we hope this will lead to an even better
experienceCongratulations to the Server First Hexfall team!
