Everyone welcome our newest member to the moderator team!
@pokushokus17 üèìWe are 1 hour out from the release of Sirius! For
the time being, we have shut off other bosses in order to
prevent further server strain than there already will be.
Furthermore, in order to optimize server load caused by
constantly ongoing fights, Sirius' release will be limited to
&bodd numbered&r ring shards: ring, ring-3, ring-5, etc. (this
is one ring shard per server ip).
Please make sure you are on a proper world in time for launch,
and we hope to see you all there!Sirius has been opened on all
&beven numbered&r ring shards: ring-2, ring-4, ring-6, ring-8,
ring-10. Please spread out in more rings to reduce
lag.@MagicalSharkHekawt, Eldrask and Kaul have been reopened in
all valleys now that Sirius fights have stabilised
&bUpdate to<#313404235544788993> Post Rules&r
Hi everyone,
The channel specific rules for <#313404235544788993> have been
updated to the following:
‚Ä¢ You may repost your guild/Monumenta related community
advertisement once per month
‚Ä¢ You are not required to delete previous posts, but you may
still do so if you wish
‚Ä¢ Posts from users no longer in the Discord, deleted users, or
with dead Discord links are subject to removal without warning.
Please save the contents of your posts beforehand.
The channel description will be updated to reflect these changes
shortly.Due to a number of ongoing recurring bugs and issues
that have been plaguing moderaters for months, the Teal dungeon
will be receiving a significant under-the-hood overhaul with
this week's update.
If you have an open Teal instance, or plan to open one, please
complete it and make sure that it is
&bready to abandon&r following update. We cannot promise that
old instances will not become incompletable.As a reminder of the
announcement above, please finish any active Teal instances that
you may have
&bprior&r to update tonight. Old instances will become
incompletable.There is currently a bug with the Sirius out of
bounds kill zone. If you wish to spectate the fight, please stay
away from the barriers surrounding the arena. Failing to stay
far enough away results in taking Void damage (that is, Shatter
3 and loss of levels). You may get one "freebie" refund in case
you get too close, but moderators will not refund on subsequent
deaths.~~Eldrask is temporarily disabled due to a bug with
icicles not working.~~ Eldrask is reopened.
