Hey @everyone !
I'm happy to announce that Hexfall, our brand new 4-player raid
content, will be releasing on
&b<t:1725724800:F>&r!  Alongside Hexfall, with our next patch on
Thursday a new prelude quest "Bad Moon Rising" will be releasing
covering the events leading up to the raid. This raid is easily
the hardest and most mechanically challenging piece of content
the server has yet seen and will be a monumental hurdle for even
the most experienced teams, so be prepared! We're beyond excited
to watch you all tackle this content and hope you'll enjoy
playing it as much as we enjoyed making it.

&bNew Zenith Charm Auction Bot:&r
Hey everyone,
A new bot @Monumenta Charms Bot, is here to manage Zenith charm
auctions! Simply head to <#313066655494438922> and get the
@Zenith Auctions role, then head to <#1249243796701577298> and
run /help for a basic command list, and explanations on what
each command does.
The previous system of manually creating and typing in bids has
caused moderation issues and has made it hard to find the charms
you are looking for. The new bot aims to solve these issues by
having standardized rules and search features.
The currently active Auctions Thread will remain open for the
time being, but all new charm auctions should be moved over to
the bot.
If you have found any bugs, please message @pe.li. Expect the
bot to be down sometimes for the first week until it is fully
stabilized.Hey @everyone , just a reminder that 49 minutes from
this message, our new raid
&bHexfall&r will be releasing!
Form up a team of 4 and be ready for some of the hardest
challenges the game has to offer. We hope you all have as much
fun playing as we did making it!
Good luck everyone!We have a hotfix coming in for Hexfall in
around an hour. At that time we will be breifly restarting the
server so these changes can take effect.We have a second hotfix
coming in 20 mins aimed at improving Ru'Ten significantly with
some changes to Hycenea as well. Thank you very much for your
patience today, we hope this will lead to an even better
experienceCongratulations to the Server First Hexfall team!

&bDevelopment Update&r
Hey all, wanted to give the playerbase an update on Monumenta
development over the next few months by reflecting on our 2024
roadmap shared at the start of the year.
Things from the roadmap that we delivered on so far:
‚Ä¢ Market plugin
‚Ä¢ Zenith expansion
‚Ä¢ Several new quests tying up loose storylines
‚Ä¢ R1 improvements, including reworks to numerous POIs and
Sierhaven
‚Ä¢ Hexfall, the raid successor to SKT
Things we've made significant progress on:
‚Ä¢ Both overworld replayability features are still being worked
on actively and are growing further to completion. We still
expect both to be out this year
‚Ä¢ The next traditional mainline dungeon, based in Star Point has
had major progress and is looking great
‚Ä¢ 1.20 update is progressing on the build server, but will need
testing before we share anything about updating the play server
What has been pushed out:
‚Ä¢ Work on the next R3 expansion has only begun quite recently.
There are a few reasons for this. The team is low on active
builders, there was significant burnout post Star Point release,
and there was a desire to focus on repolishing some early game
R1 content in order to put our best foot forward for new
players. As a result, we are in the design and ideation phase
for our next expansion, and it will certainly not be ready to
ship this year. We know this is disappointing given we typically
have a sizeable holiday release, but hope the transparency is
appreciated and the team is looking forward to a productive
2025.
Finally, some new stuff coming soon that wasn't on the roadmap:
‚Ä¢ Some exciting new features are coming to Celestial Zenith
later this month
‚Ä¢ A recent development planned for release in the not-too-
distant future, the team has been working hard on a new Strike
set deep below the Architect's Ring! This Strike, conceived as a
spiritual successor to the Sealed Remorse, is the product of a
team-wide development jam hosted in August.
As always, thanks for your patience and support!
&bAttention All Fellow Cleric Players&r
It is with great regret I announce that I messed up the changes
to Divine Justice that were pushed with the latest balance
patch. There was a hotfix to temporarily address the issue but
it should not remain in place for the rest of the month since it
is an unintentional buff to high damage builds while hurting
medium to low damage builds. Therefore, you can expect there to
be another set of changes to Divine Justice and its charms with
this next update that attempt to address these issues.
