&bThe Architect's Ring: Indigo Wool Dungeon&r
After nearly two years of planning and development, the third
mainline, traditional-style dungeon for the Architect's Ring has
finally arrived! As the culmination of your adventure throughout
Star Point, the time has come to break the seal to Phyrrys and
attempt to claim the Indigo Wool for yourself!
It won't be an easy endeavor though, as foes and former-allies
alike will stand in your way, each with their own agenda • so
prepare yourself for the challenge that awaits you within...
Grab your friends and mark your calendars, because the dungeon
will be live on <t:1752944400:F> !
To accompany the dungeon's release, a new quest in Chapter 3,
&bHolding Space&r, will be available immediately following
weekly update! Requiring &oStarless Night&r, &oAll That
Remains&r, and completion of any level of &oCelestial Zenith&r •
the quest will be progressable up until the point that you
discover the lobby...
The team has poured an incredible amount of time and passion
into this dungeon and everything surrounding it, and we can't
wait for you all to enjoy! @everyone

&bHappy Depths-versary!&r
It's that time of the year again• to celebrate the fourth
anniversary of Darkest Depths release (July 17, 2021), six

other friends and compete for the special leaderboard spots for
an extended run of two weeks. The event starts after the weekly
update tomorrow, July 16, and runs until the weekly update of
July 30. Good luck and have fun!World Bosses have been disabled
for Indigo's release in 10 minutes.Right now seems like a
wonderful time, for absolutely no reason whatsoever, to re-
establish with our existing community (and well-inform our
new/recent players) of Monumenta's financial gain stance:
• Monumenta is a &ovolunteer&r-operated project. Our developers,
moderators, and contributors do not get paid or otherwise make
any profit from their work on Monumenta
• Our funds that we receive from Patreon strictly go towards
keeping the lights on, upgrading our infrastructure, and keeping
our plugins online
• We have long repeated this, but it is our vow to the community
(and to ourselves, morally) that Monumenta will &nnever&r
introduce pay-to-win (p2w) aspects, in any form, in an effort to
extort more money from our community
If you enjoy playing Monumenta, especially with the recent
release of the Indigo dungeon, and would like to see more
content like it, as well as desire potential infrasture boons
that require fiscal means (eg, true-local EU and EA servers),
then we ask only that you consider subscribing to our Patreon at
https://www.patreon.com/MonumentaMMO . Our community is the
reason for our continuity, and we hope to see this game forward
for as long as we can!Happy to announce that @Chiinox_ has
joined the Monumenta Leads team, stepping into the more
"official" role of Balance Lead! Someone who needs no real
introduction, Chiinox has been with TM for nearly 3 years now,
and has recently taken heavy initiative to reframe our internal
balance team.
We've all seen the great strides he's made and believe him to be
a strong guide for setting the direction of the game moving
forward. Please make sure to give him the congratulatory 🏓The

&b2026 Monumenta Roadmap&r
Hello everyone! It's been a year since our last roadmap update,
so we thought it would be a good time to address some of our
priorities and upcoming projects as we look towards Monumenta
development in 2026. This is mainly focused on our larger
efforts, so if you don't see something here, it doesn't
necessarily mean it isn't on our radar.
• Over the last year, we've been rebuilding the early game from
the ground up to better showcase Monumenta to our new players.
Along with a full labs & tutorial rework, the swamp overworld
has been entirely rebuilt with both new and returning pois,
discoveries, secrets and remastered quests.
• We're also revitalizing the early game by tweaking dungeon
rewards & skill point progression, paired with full reworks of
class ability descriptions for readability and comprehension,
the return of natural spawns, and more friendly overworld death
systems.
• The near future will bring a finale expansion for Star Point,
wrapping up the main Chapter 3 questline and bringing you face
to face with the consequences of Aurora's actions within
Phyrrys!
• Our next overworld expansion has begun development! It is the
team's top priority to release with several new POIs and quests
alongside a traditional dungeon in late 2026. Taking what we've
learned from the R1 Revamp, we hope to create a richer overworld
with secrets, challenges and the return of natural spawns. We're
also designing with expandability in mind, so that new story
quests and major content can be released post launch without a
significant build-overhead.
• We know it's been a little while since there's been any news
about Exalted dungeons. As 2025 draws to a close, we'll be
prioritizing the R2 Exalted suite for releases all throughout
2026, beginning with Lime and Pink early next year.
• We also haven't forgotten about our next R3 strike release, as
we're completing the final stages of boss development before
entering testing. The full release is expected in 2026.
• One of the most ambitious quests we've ever attempted to
produce • a large scale "open zone" quest, on the scope of A
Study in Crimson or beyond. A culmination of nearly two years in
development aimed to bring several aspects of the story front
and center, and push them forward into the future.
• Beyond all the new content with new quests, we're also looking
back at older quest lines that remain unfinished as of now.
We're looking to finish at least one storyline, if not more, in
2026, with the Duchess series being a primary focus to bring to
a close next year.
As always, thanks for your patience and support!
