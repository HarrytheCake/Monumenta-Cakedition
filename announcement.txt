&bOpen Call for Quest Dev Applications:&r
Hey everyone, I'd like to take some time to put out an open call
for applications for anyone who is interested in applying to
Team Monumenta as a Quest Developer. Over the years, our quest
team has grown and thinned out fluxuatingly, and we'd like to
expand a bit in order to alleviate work load.
&nFor this application, you:&r
Don't Need:
‚Ä¢ To come in with extensive and exhaustive lore knowledge
‚Ä¢ To have written your own story before
‚Ä¢ To have a deep knowledge of minecraft mechanisms
Need:
‚Ä¢ Willingness to discuss ideas with the quest team and iterate
until a product is worth making
‚Ä¢ Willingness to learn ScriptedQuests and small scale minecraft
commands
‚Ä¢ General good standing with the community as any application
would require
I need to heavily stress the "willingness to learn" part of this
‚Ä¢ Monumenta is driven by people who are motivated to see
something through to the end. This is
&bnot&r a call for people who just want to write lore and
nothing else, but for people who are willing to learn the
systems that drive quest development (the ScriptedQuests
structure, and minecraft commands) and implement their ideas. We
can teach you what you need to know, but you must also have your
own passion for it.
If these conditions fit you, you may apply by directly DM'ing
me, or any other lead, or @AristotleVery happy to announce that
both @panderz14 and @nicknon have been promoted to Monumenta
developer Leads!
Nicknon is one of our most prolific back-end developers,
supporting content releases anywhere and everywhere that he is
called upon, as well as being a guiding voice in gameplay
design. Panderz meanwhile has been a powerhouse of driving
content development for some time now, overseeing several
projects, such as the currently ongoing Sierhaven/R1 rebuilds.
Excited to have them join the Leads team to drive the direction
of Monumenta in the days to come!
Further, @certified portal fan and @[PP] Mehaz have both joined
Team Monumenta as developers!
Flowey has been greatly assisting our server ops team,
overseeing the steps towards Monumenta's next version upgrade!
Mehaz meanwhile has been working hard on an upcoming piece of
Raid content that will be coming to you all in the near future!
Very happy to have them both on the team!
Make sure to give all 4 of these guys the congradulatory ping üèì
&bHappy Depths-versary!&r
To celebrate the third anniversary of Darkest Depths release
(July 17, 2021), six player mode is making a return! Start a run
with up to five other friends and compete for the special
leaderboard spots for an extended run of two weeks. The event
starts after the weekly update tonight, July 11, and runs until
the weekly update of July 25. Good luck, have fun, and keep an
eye out for some more changes soon!
&bSpeed Bug&r
Tonight we fixed an issue that would give some players permanent
+10% speed, including in areas where speed effects were not
supposed to take effect. The issue stemmed from the Patron
Shrine speed effect not always getting cleared properly, and was
not triggered intentionally. Fortunately, no other Patron Shrine
effects were affected because they did not modify attributes
directly. We aren't sure precisely how long this issue has been
around for, but it is probably somewhere in the range of 1-2
years. Obviously, this bug affects races and multiple world
records are confirmed to have unintentionally had this issue,
and are therefore likely impossible now. Since we were already
considering doing "soft resets" to some race leaderboards (see h
ttps://discord.com/channels/313066655494438922/33780419064889344
1/1260453584710008905), we will wait until further decisions
have been made and will update leaderboards at some future
time.@xernial and @qwanton have just become our newest
developers! Xernial has contributed various features such as the
recent cleric cosmetic set, and Qwanton has made some races and
worked on the seasonal pass, among other projects. Please
welcome them both with plenty of pings! üèì
&bRules Update&r
A new Market Rule has been added.
`Currency loaning services are not permitted. Item loaning (or
‚Äúrental‚Äù) services are allowed.`
&bOpen Call for Building Developer Applications:&r
Hey all, we're putting out this call for anyone that is
interested in joining TM as a Builder. Building is one of the
largest bottlenecks for releasing new content, and we're hoping
to grow our rosters so that we can release high quality content
more often.
&nTo apply, we ask that you:&r
‚Ä¢ Can work collaboratively with other builders and parts of the
team
‚Ä¢ Can create unique gameplay spaces and visual themes
‚Ä¢ Can take feedback & constructive criticism from your peers
‚Ä¢ Have basic familiarity with build tools such as FAWE (World
Edit), FAVS (VoxelSniper), or Axiom
A key factor to success as a builder is your ability to self
motivate. We're looking for people not only with a knack for
building but also those who can see their builds through to
completion in a timely manner.
If you feel you may not have sufficient skill with building, but
have experience with gameplay/level design and a willingness to
learn building, we would also like to consider your application.
Having played through most Monumenta content is a great boon as
to familiarize yourself with our level style.
For those interested in applying, please fill out the Monumenta
Developer Application form here:
https://forms.gle/GpvFvpNVGKSNjFCP8.
&bPlease provide a showcase/portfolio of your work for us to get
an idea of your build skills, either linked in the application
itself, or DM'd to Aristotle.&r Solo builds are preferred, but
if any of it was done with other people, please make it clear
what part of it was your work.Hello everyone! We‚Äôre thrilled to
announce the next piece of Monumenta Raid content coming to the
server:
&bHexfall&r!
The spiritual successor to Silver Knight‚Äôs Tomb, Hexfall
features the finale of the story of Hycenea and Harrakfar, the
Blue Wool. This raid will pit you against two fearsome new raid
bosses posing threats not seen before in Monumenta.  Hexfall
features some of the most mechanically complex fights to date
that will test the limits of you and your party. You'll find
unique, gameplay-altering patterns throughout each fight that
will test your problem-solving capabilities and reflexes. This
raid emphasizes mechanical difficulty, and will require
progression more akin to a traditional MMO raid tier.
We‚Äôre incredibly excited for you all to take on the challenges
that lie in wait in Hexfall at the beginning of September!
&bPUPPET, HOW YOU WANDER WEAKLY
KNOWING NAUGHT OF WHOM YOU SERVE
MEAGER CHILD, RAISING FEEBLY
STEEL AGAINST OUR IRON NERVE
FOR I AM LIFE, AND YOURS I‚ÄôVE WATCHED.
YOUR VILE DEEDS CORRUPT AND REND
GREAT EMPERORS AND KINGS AND GODS
YOU‚ÄôVE FELLED, YET HERE YOU‚ÄôLL MEET YOUR END&rHey @everyone !
I'm happy to announce that Hexfall, our brand new 4-player raid
content, will be releasing on
&b<t:1725724800:F>&r!  Alongside Hexfall, with our next patch on
Thursday a new prelude quest "Bad Moon Rising" will be releasing
covering the events leading up to the raid. This raid is easily
the hardest and most mechanically challenging piece of content
the server has yet seen and will be a monumental hurdle for even
the most experienced teams, so be prepared! We're beyond excited
to watch you all tackle this content and hope you'll enjoy
playing it as much as we enjoyed making it.

&bNew Zenith Charm Auction Bot:&r
Hey everyone,
A new bot @Monumenta Charms Bot, is here to manage Zenith charm
auctions! Simply head to <#313066655494438922> and get the
@Zenith Auctions role, then head to <#1249243796701577298> and
run /help for a basic command list, and explanations on what
each command does.
The previous system of manually creating and typing in bids has
caused moderation issues and has made it hard to find the charms
you are looking for. The new bot aims to solve these issues by
having standardized rules and search features.
The currently active Auctions Thread will remain open for the
time being, but all new charm auctions should be moved over to
the bot.
If you have found any bugs, please message @pe.li. Expect the
bot to be down sometimes for the first week until it is fully
stabilized.
