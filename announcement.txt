Hey @everyone! The trailer for our biggest launch of the year is
about to go live‚Ä¢ come join us for the premier in just a minute!
You'll find it just above this message.&nClosing Points:&r
Unlike with the initial release of Region 3, we will be staging
these updates ‚Ä¢ releasing them separately across the updates of
December. This will allow us to more dedicatedly pinpoint
feedback for each portion of this expansion, as well allow each
piece of content its own time to breathe in the spotlight.
With all that said, we can't wait for you to jump in and play
these 3 pieces of content, as well as some further major pieces
coming to the Ring that we can't yet talk about, slated for
early next year!
The Star Point overworld expansions launches next weekend,

enjoy!

&bArchitect's Ring Expansion 1: Star Point&r
Part 2 of the Architect's Ring is finally coming, the first
major expansion to Monumenta's third region. After nearly a year
of hard development, we're excited to finally share with you
what the next chapter in Monumenta's history will entail!
&nOverworld Expansion: Star Point&r
The bridge to the south of New Antium has recently undergone a
mysterious transformation, opening the path forward to the
Serebrium Citadel, Star Point. In this massive extension of the
Ring's overworld, you will find six brand new POIs to explore
and conquer!
This biome also brings along with it the addition of Masterwork
level 4, allowing you to upgrade your gear up to the Artifact
tier! Furthermore, multiple new quests can be discovered,
pushing the mainline story of the Architect's Ring into Chapter
3!
&nNew Dungeon: The Celestial Zenith&r
A brand new dungeon is coming to Monumenta, the Celestial
Zenith! This procedural dungeon is a spiritual successor to the
Darkest Depths, expanding and improving upon several concepts
found within to create what we hope to be the most replayable
piece of content ever released!
Don't take your familiarity with Depths as a sign of comfort,
however, as you never know what changes may await you! Keep your
eyes peeled, because we will be releasing more in-depth
information about Zenith soon.
&nNew World Boss: Sirius, the Final Herald&r
A new world boss descends to Monumenta, the Starspawned
Calamity, Sirius ‚Ä¢ the final herald of the Stars. Gather
together with your friends and allies, and take down this threat
to the Ring for good!
This fight showcases mechanics never before seen in a world
boss, and is shaping up to be a fight unlike any other!I'm happy
to announce that @ascynx and @[WOOL] ChargingUv have joined the
development team! Ascynx has worked on many plugin features as
well as contributing to the Unofficial Monumenta Mod, while
Charging has contributed many builds, including rooms for
Celestial Zenith, R1 POI reworks, and more future content. Don't
forget to give them their well-earned üèìKeep a lookout tomorrow
for our next major reveal üëÄ

Credit to @Christmastotle for the video as always.After
listening to player feedback, and discussing internally how we
want the Masterwork system to feel, the consensus is that on
average the current M4 upgrades do not provide a satisfactory
increase in strength relative to delve scaling. As a result,
every M4 item is having its stats re-evaluated and re-balanced
to be more inline with what would be expected from the other
Masterwork upgrades, ready for next week. As a warning, this
will involve a very large number of stat changes for M4 items in
particular, with the goal of making them feel both more
powerful, and more interesting (as a large proportion received
only 0.5 Armor/Agility). We hope that this is able to provide a
more satisfactory feeling to your Masterwork upgrades in the
long-run and that this announcement can help you make informed
decisions prior to the weekly update.@Koko
&bNew Player Questions has been revamped!&r
Similarly to <#1165742923510468618>' recent transformation to a
forum channel, <#1184711607423615077> has also been changed to a
forum channel to allow frequently asked questions to be more
easily searchable. Players can search for keywords using the
search bar to find posts addressing commonly asked questions or
use tags to filter through the entries. If a new player cannot
find the answer to their question, they can still create a post
within the forum channel for other players to respond, and
resolved inquiries will still be cleared frequently.
Please check out <#1184799684565413929> for more information.Due
to an unfortunate oversight, all custom ability triggers for
players who have logged in between the weekly update and now
have been cleared. Since the only way to restore these settings
would be to roll everything back to the weekly update, which we
have decided not to do, any affected players will have to
recreate their triggers. Shards will be restarting soon to fix
this as well as the class GUI not opening from the Professor or
D'Orin. Players who haven't logged in since the update are
unaffected.
