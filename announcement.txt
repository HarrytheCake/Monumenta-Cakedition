There is currently a bug with the Sirius out of bounds kill
zone. If you wish to spectate the fight, please stay away from
the barriers surrounding the arena. Failing to stay far enough
away results in taking Void damage (that is, Shatter 3 and loss
of levels). You may get one "freebie" refund in case you get too
close, but moderators will not refund on subsequent
deaths.~~Eldrask is temporarily disabled due to a bug with
icicles not working.~~ Eldrask is reopened.
&bRegarding the Recent Ban Wave&r
Hi everyone,
There has been a critical exploit present in the Celestial
Zenith since its release that allowed players who died to remain
in the instance, and be resurrected after the defeat of a boss
with no penalty. This bug was abused by a substantial number of
players which led to undeserved wins. This bug was reported
shortly after Zenith's release, but it unfortunately fell to the
wayside as we attempted to fix bugs and integrate feedback.
While we are responsible for this, what is not okay is that
&bthis bug was only reported by two players, despite obviously
being an exploit of game systems.&r
After we received the second report, a significant investigation
was launched where we tracked down every possible instance of a
player abusing the bug, and we have manually removed those who
were flagged with insufficient evidence. All who remained lost
their leaderboard positions, were given temporary bans based on
how many times they used the exploit, and lost up to 3 Zenith
Charm Power. For those that remember the Horseman Massacre, this
situation is significantly different because the exploit was
deliberately hidden from TM by certain circles of the community
and it was exploited over a longer period of time.
We are reasonably confident that those who were punished are
fully responsible for their actions, but we have most likely
missed a few players. Due to the lack of evidence from our
investigation, we will not punish anyone who possibly knew about
the exploit but failed to report it. Punishments can be appealed
by privately messaging a Moderator on Discord ‚Ä¢ we are trying
our best to handle this situation as fairly as possible.
For those who have cleared the Celestial Zenith at least once
without abusing this exploit, you may find yourself contacted by
your unexpected benefactor during the weekly dungeon instance
reset...
As always, please directly report gamebreaking exploits or bugs
to a Moderator.For an easy way to get to your logs folder from
your Minecraft client regardless of what you're using, go to
`Options` -> `Resource Packs...` -> `Open Pack Folder`, go up
one folder, and check the `logs` folder. `latest.log` is the
latest log file. You may need an archive manager that supports
the gzip file format for the `.gz` compressed log files from
previous days/sessions.The function that grants the Ladder of
Honesty currently has unintended behavior. If you are eligible
for the trophy, you must stay in the same shard for at least 15
seconds after logging on post weekly dungeon reset to receive
it. If you believe you were not given the Ladder of Honesty
correctly, please DM @spy1dd. Include a snippet of your
Minecraft log that shows you either logged off or changed shards
after logging on post dungeon reset. This log will be present
somewhere within
`C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\logs\` on vanilla
or in `\.minecraft\logs\` on a third party launcher.
&bMonumenta Server Infrastructure Update & Downtime&r
&bTLDR: We are upgrading our server infrastructure over the next
two weeks, and this will require some play server downtime, most
notably on Sunday. &r
&nMore detail: &r
Monumenta currently runs on five physical servers in North
America (east coast Canada), and one in Europe (France).
Several of these servers are quite old, including the "main"
server, monumenta-8, which we leased 3-4 years ago.
OVH (our hosting company) recently launched some new server
offerings which are going to be both faster and more affordable
for us overall. So we are looking at moving to them, and taking
this opportunity to update a number of supporting tools that we
use (for example, the main servers currently run Ubuntu 18.04,
which is more than 5 years old at this point, the version of
kubernetes we use is 3 years old... etc.).
&nWhat this means for you: &r
‚Ä¢ Weekly update downtime this week will be a bit longer (approx
2.5 hours) as we move some underlying data around. The shards
will continue to run where they are now.
‚Ä¢ On Sunday, we are planning to do the "actual" move, which we
currently think will involve around 4 hours of server downtime.
This will likely be Sunday afternoon US time. We will announce
the specific timeframe Saturday night.
‚Ä¢ After this move, many of the current bungeecord proxies will
be shut down. If you're connecting to
`server.playmonumenta.com`, that'll still work fine, but if
you're connecting to specific proxies (i.e. monumenta-8), you'll
need to update these. More info will be shared when that
happens.
‚Ä¢ Over the next week, many non-game things will likely be
unstable ‚Ä¢ for example the item API that powers the oh-the-
misery index, the website, advancements page, etc.
‚Ä¢ Next week's update will also be longer as we settle things
into their final resting places.
Many thanks to our current & past Patreons, who continue to make
Monumenta's upkeep sustainable.The server is going down for
planned maintenance at <t:1707085800:t> (<t:1707085800:R>); we
plan to be down for 4 hours.Please welcome @[PP] Firestorm to
