&bMonumenta Server Infrastructure Update & Downtime&r
&bTLDR: We are upgrading our server infrastructure over the next
two weeks, and this will require some play server downtime, most
notably on Sunday. &r
&nMore detail: &r
Monumenta currently runs on five physical servers in North
America (east coast Canada), and one in Europe (France).
Several of these servers are quite old, including the "main"
server, monumenta-8, which we leased 3-4 years ago.
OVH (our hosting company) recently launched some new server
offerings which are going to be both faster and more affordable
for us overall. So we are looking at moving to them, and taking
this opportunity to update a number of supporting tools that we
use (for example, the main servers currently run Ubuntu 18.04,
which is more than 5 years old at this point, the version of
kubernetes we use is 3 years old... etc.).
&nWhat this means for you: &r
‚Ä¢ Weekly update downtime this week will be a bit longer (approx
2.5 hours) as we move some underlying data around. The shards
will continue to run where they are now.
‚Ä¢ On Sunday, we are planning to do the "actual" move, which we
currently think will involve around 4 hours of server downtime.
This will likely be Sunday afternoon US time. We will announce
the specific timeframe Saturday night.
‚Ä¢ After this move, many of the current bungeecord proxies will
be shut down. If you're connecting to
`server.playmonumenta.com`, that'll still work fine, but if
you're connecting to specific proxies (i.e. monumenta-8), you'll
need to update these. More info will be shared when that
happens.
‚Ä¢ Over the next week, many non-game things will likely be
unstable ‚Ä¢ for example the item API that powers the oh-the-
misery index, the website, advancements page, etc.
‚Ä¢ Next week's update will also be longer as we settle things
into their final resting places.
Many thanks to our current & past Patreons, who continue to make
Monumenta's upkeep sustainable.The server is going down for
planned maintenance at <t:1707085800:t> (<t:1707085800:R>); we
plan to be down for 4 hours.Please welcome @[PP] Firestorm to

&bChanges to moderation and team roles&r
The Monumenta community has grown significantly over the last
few years. In the earlier days of the server, the team structure
was relatively flat and fluid, with many developers and
moderators holding dual roles. As the server has grown, these
roles have considerably diverged, with the modern moderation
team largely being independent from the development team in
terms of deciding/upholding rules, helping players, and handling
appeals/punishments.
However, an exception to this increasing distinction had still
remained ‚Ä¢ the Monumenta Leads, who have publicly straddled both
roles in making decisions on both moderation and development.
Today, the Leads primarily front development of the game and
have internally stepped back from moderation. Occassionally
however, Leads have still been called upon by players for
moderation issues like appeals.
At the same time, they also acted as the group of people with
the "final authority" on moderation decisions, in the rare cases
of contentions (both internal and external) with moderation
decisions ‚Ä¢ a role they also wished to relinquish to people more
heavily in-tune with community moderation.
As such, moving forward, the Monumenta Leads role will be
stepping down from all involvement in moderation affairs, and a
new
&bModerator Leads&r role will be added to fill this void in
"final authority", with @Pakstf, @[VH] Aramil, and @michthemoo
designated as Moderator Leads (MLs).
&nWhat this means in practice&r
‚Ä¢ Monumenta Leads (@Combustible "Busty" , @Crondis,
@NickNackGus, @nobodypi, @shadowvisions, @squirrr, @chipmunk46)
will be stepping back from all issues related to moderation. We
ask that you not approach them in attempt to subvert moderator
decisions.
‚Ä¢ For in-game and in-discord <#358326443609948160> issues, there
is no change to the way players interact with the mod team. All
mods, including the new Moderator Leads, have the same
permissions and will be able to help with any issues you may
encounter. Please continue to ping @ Moderator where necessary,
and use the /mh channel in game.
‚Ä¢ Moderation decisions will continue to be made collectively by
the moderator team. This means that you should continue to send
bugs/appeals/any moderation questions to
&bany moderator&r, who will pass it on to the team to be
discussed before a decision is made. Decisions conveyed by any
moderator can generally be assumed to be on behalf of the entire
moderator team.
‚Ä¢ While the above is true for 99% of situations, there are a
small number of cases where players may wish to contest
decisions made by moderators. In these cases, you can reach out
to individual MLs with your concerns. The MLs will take these up
internally and get back to you.
As always, thank you for your support of the server and for both
the moderation and development teams. Moving forward, we hope
that this will make it clearer for players who to approach for
situations where mods are required, while allowing the
Development Leads to focus on making great content for the game.
&bImportant&r
The amount of players required to found a guild is being lowered
to 4.
Additionally, Market Rule G4 is receiving an update. The new
rule is as follows:
`G.4: A guild stall can only be owned by a guild having at least
4 active members.`Sorry for keeping you all waiting, I have been
bit more busy than I would like during my vacation.
A big THANK YOU to the Monumenta team for allowing me to
announce the release of my new map in this channel:
RAGECRAFT IV (for Minecraft version 1.20.1)
Explore the vast underworld and fight your way through hordes of
monsters in perilous environments! Can you retrieve the mythical
crystals and complete the monument?
This survival-style CTM map features 16 massive dungeons, a
unique crafting system that goes far beyond normal Minecraft
mechanics, and a semi-open underground world containing
innumerable challenges and secrets. And who knows, maybe you'll
even find some things that feel vaguely familiar as a Monumenta
player üòâ
The map is scheduled for release on:
Sunday, April 7, 10 PM CET
Map Creator: heliceo
Datapack Contributor: Suso
Custom Textures: cocoacollei
Trailer: Counter_Coffee

&bConcerning Discord's New Poll Feature&r
Discord, in its infinite wisdom, has tied the new Polls feature
to the ability for people to send/view messages in channels.
While the Polls feature can be useful in certain situations, we
do not want our server to be bombarded with spurious and spammy
polls. Going forward, polls should only be used in situations
where it makes sense such as information/opinion gathering for
topics in the Feedback category, or crowd sourcing build ideas
in appropriate channels. The moderation team reserves the right
to remove polls at our discretion. Users who continuously spam
polls will be warned and muted.## Announcing the Closure of the
Barrel Bazaar
&bImportant: The player market will continue to remain
operational for the time being. Player and Guild shop stalls
will continue to function as normal.&r
&bIf you currently have unlinked market plugin listings from
before the hotfix, please message a moderator in game to resolve
the issue.&r
Hi all,
The barrel bazaar has seen a ton of use and history since its
opening in February of 2021, mostly for the better. However, as
the server has grown and player wares have diversified, the
barrel bazaar has not kept up ‚Ä¢ its limited space became hotly
contested and the difficulty of searching through it had led to
much player and moderator frustration. Now that the official
market plugin has been stable for several weeks, the moderation
team is taking this opportunity to officially cease operations
of the barrel bazaar in favor of the market plugin.
&nWhat this means for barrel owners and prospective barrel
owners:&r
Your wares are still available and safe. Your barrels have not
been touched at the time of this post. However, the moderation
team encourages you to begin the process of reclaiming any items
and currency you may have, as the barrel bazaar will be closing
soon. For players that were looking to set up a barrel bazaar
shop, we encourage you to instead use the market plugin.
&nWhat this means for shoppers:&r
Hopefully, the market plugin serves your needs significantly
better. We expect that there may be some pushback since the
market filters feature is not yet in place, but rest assured
that it is nearing completing and will be coming out soon.
&bModerators will begin the process of moving barrels to player
plots starting at <t:1713715200>. No additional claims will be
allowed past this time.&r
