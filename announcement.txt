&bThe Architect's Ring: Indigo Wool Dungeon&r
After nearly two years of planning and development, the third
mainline, traditional-style dungeon for the Architect's Ring has
finally arrived! As the culmination of your adventure throughout
Star Point, the time has come to break the seal to Phyrrys and
attempt to claim the Indigo Wool for yourself!
It won't be an easy endeavor though, as foes and former-allies
alike will stand in your way, each with their own agenda ‚Ä¢ so
prepare yourself for the challenge that awaits you within...
Grab your friends and mark your calendars, because the dungeon
will be live on <t:1752944400:F> !
To accompany the dungeon's release, a new quest in Chapter 3,
&bHolding Space&r, will be available immediately following
weekly update! Requiring &oStarless Night&r, &oAll That
Remains&r, and completion of any level of &oCelestial Zenith&r ‚Ä¢
the quest will be progressable up until the point that you
discover the lobby...
The team has poured an incredible amount of time and passion
into this dungeon and everything surrounding it, and we can't
wait for you all to enjoy! @everyone

&bHappy Depths-versary!&r
It's that time of the year again‚Ä¢ to celebrate the fourth
anniversary of Darkest Depths release (July 17, 2021), six
player mode is making a return! Start a run with up to five
other friends and compete for the special leaderboard spots for
an extended run of two weeks. The event starts after the weekly
update tomorrow, July 16, and runs until the weekly update of
July 30. Good luck and have fun!World Bosses have been disabled
for Indigo's release in 10 minutes.Right now seems like a
wonderful time, for absolutely no reason whatsoever, to re-
establish with our existing community (and well-inform our
new/recent players) of Monumenta's financial gain stance:
‚Ä¢ Monumenta is a &ovolunteer&r-operated project. Our developers,
moderators, and contributors do not get paid or otherwise make
any profit from their work on Monumenta
‚Ä¢ Our funds that we receive from Patreon strictly go towards
keeping the lights on, upgrading our infrastructure, and keeping
our plugins online
‚Ä¢ We have long repeated this, but it is our vow to the community
(and to ourselves, morally) that Monumenta will &nnever&r
introduce pay-to-win (p2w) aspects, in any form, in an effort to
extort more money from our community
If you enjoy playing Monumenta, especially with the recent
release of the Indigo dungeon, and would like to see more
content like it, as well as desire potential infrasture boons
that require fiscal means (eg, true-local EU and EA servers),
then we ask only that you consider subscribing to our Patreon at
https://www.patreon.com/MonumentaMMO . Our community is the
reason for our continuity, and we hope to see this game forward
for as long as we can!Happy to announce that @Chiinox_ has
joined the Monumenta Leads team, stepping into the more
"official" role of Balance Lead! Someone who needs no real
introduction, Chiinox has been with TM for nearly 3 years now,
and has recently taken heavy initiative to reframe our internal
balance team.
We've all seen the great strides he's made and believe him to be
a strong guide for setting the direction of the game moving
forward. Please make sure to give him the congratulatory üèìThe
MONU discord tag has been re-enabled. Thanks everyone for
boosting our discord, we really appreciate it!Please welcome

congratulatory üèì s!If you are having trouble connecting to
