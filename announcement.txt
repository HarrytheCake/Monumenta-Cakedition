Monumenta #announcements
A while ago, we moved the [Official Monumenta
Wiki](https://monumenta.wiki.gg/wiki/Monumenta_Wiki) from Fandom
to wiki.gg. Unfortunately, because of Fandom’s rules, we cannot
remove the wiki nor link to the new one; Fandom will consider
edits of this sort vandalism and revert them. In order for
wiki.gg to appear as the first Google search result, we advise
not visiting the Fandom wiki at all, even for purposes of
vandalism/linking to wiki.gg. Thank you to all players who have
contributed to the wiki!
**Exalted Dungeons, Batch 4: Malevolent Reverie!**  Very happy
to announce that the finale of the R1 Exalted dungeon line is on
its way, the Exalted Malevolent Reverie! The mob and balance
team has been working extremely diligently over the course of
the past few months to ensure that this milestone for Exalteds
lives up to its expectations, and we're excited for you to
finally get your hands on it.  Keep on guard and your eyes
peeled, because you never know what may have changed as you
delve back into the nightmare of the Exalted Reverie, arriving
next weekend at our usual launch window, <t:1699722000:F>!  We
hope to see you all there! @everyone   ||P■■as■ ■■ve■tu■e■, ■

Please do not pick Vengeful in Exalted Reverie **as of now**, as
some mobs break due to the modifier.

Hey @everyone! The trailer for our biggest launch of the year is
about to go live- come join us for the premier in just a minute!
You'll find it just above this message.
__Closing Points:__  Unlike with the initial release of Region
3, we will be staging these updates - releasing them separately
across the updates of December. This will allow us to more
dedicatedly pinpoint feedback for each portion of this
expansion, as well allow each piece of content its own time to
breathe in the spotlight.  With all that said, we can't wait for
you to jump in and play these 3 pieces of content, as well as
some further major pieces coming to the Ring that we can't yet
talk about, slated for early next year!   The Star Point
overworld expansions launches next weekend, <t:1702144800:F>  To
hype you up and give you a taste of what to expect, we have made
an awsome trailer for your viewing pleasure. We hope you enjoy!

**Architect's Ring Expansion 1: Star Point**  Part 2 of the
Architect's Ring is finally coming, the first major expansion to
Monumenta's third region. After nearly a year of hard
development, we're excited to finally share with you what the
next chapter in Monumenta's history will entail!  __Overworld
Expansion: Star Point__  The bridge to the south of New Antium
has recently undergone a mysterious transformation, opening the
path forward to the Serebrium Citadel, Star Point. In this
massive extension of the Ring's overworld, you will find six
brand new POIs to explore and conquer!  This biome also brings
along with it the addition of Masterwork level 4, allowing you
to upgrade your gear up to the Artifact tier! Furthermore,
multiple new quests can be discovered, pushing the mainline
story of the Architect's Ring into Chapter 3!   __New Dungeon:
The Celestial Zenith__  A brand new dungeon is coming to
Monumenta, the Celestial Zenith! This procedural dungeon is a
spiritual successor to the Darkest Depths, expanding and
improving upon several concepts found within to create what we
hope to be the most replayable piece of content ever released!
Don't take your familiarity with Depths as a sign of comfort,
however, as you never know what changes may await you! Keep your
eyes peeled, because we will be releasing more in-depth
information about Zenith soon.  __New World Boss: Sirius, the
Final Herald__  A new world boss descends to Monumenta, the
Starspawned Calamity, Sirius - the final herald of the Stars.
Gather together with your friends and allies, and take down this
threat to the Ring for good!  This fight showcases mechanics
never before seen in a world boss, and is shaping up to be a
fight unlike any other!
