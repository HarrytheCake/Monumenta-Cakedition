&bDiamenean Hunts&r
Mysterious beasts have been spotted across the Architect's Ring!
Talk to a colorful cast of veteran hunters at the grand opening
of Retneau's Lodge to learn about how to hunt each quarry and
tackle their unique mechanics. Can you successfully hunt them
all down without spoiling the precious loot?
Starting after the weekly update, you can get initiated at the
Lodge in the Wolfswood and gather information on each of the 6
new bosses. The first boss will spawn somewhere in the
Architect's Ring on <t:1742673600:F> (note unusual release time)
and subsequent bosses will spawn periodically after that, with
an average time in between bosses of about 2 hours.
Please note that by the nature of this content, there is
significant downtime between hunts (similar to Treasures of
Viridia). On top of that, due to the mechanics of each boss, it
is possible to have a very low success rate at first (especially
for players who do not read the relevant dialogue from the
veteran hunters). For these reasons, please do
&bnot&r expect this new content to be the primary thing to do,
even on release day.
I hope to see everyone out on the hunting grounds!

94438922/313404193647886337/1354652991080239127, guild plots and
islands will be moving from the `plots` shard to a new
`guildplots` shard. The new plot will be fully survival mode,
about the width of a dungeon and the full height of the world,
and feature barrier blocks instead of bedrock to allow for
transparent map art and a skyblock aesthetic for anyone who
wants them. There will be no upkeep required to access any of
it, and a guild manager/founder can talk to Lectros for a refund
on any remaining days of island access. There will be plenty of
new features, including 9 new guild permissions, purchasable
Travel Anchors (intra-plot teleporters) and Shared Vaults (Bags
of Hoarding in block form, each with a separate inventory).
As for the `plots` shard, a copy of your guild plot and island
will remain there in adventure mode for anyone to visit, with
all containers locked. Visitors can read signs and lecterns,
view armor stands and item frames, and interact with villagers
(including teleporting to the guild islands). All other entities
will be removed. Guilds have until weekly update begins at
<t:1743634800:F> to make their guild plot presentable to
visitors.
We're looking forward to Moving Day, and hope you enjoy the new
guild features!This month's balance update has been delayed to
next week as we were unable to prepare changes in time for our
testing team to have adequate time to give feedback and find
issues. Going forward, we will be working on a plan internally
to try to avoid delaying future balance updates and make
adequate room for testing. We once again thank you for your
patience and understanding.Happy to announce that @[MAID]
