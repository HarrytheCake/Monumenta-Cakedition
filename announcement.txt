&bDevelopment Update&r
Hey all, wanted to give the playerbase an update on Monumenta
development over the next few months by reflecting on our 2024
roadmap shared at the start of the year.
Things from the roadmap that we delivered on so far:
‚Ä¢ Market plugin
‚Ä¢ Zenith expansion
‚Ä¢ Several new quests tying up loose storylines
‚Ä¢ R1 improvements, including reworks to numerous POIs and
Sierhaven
‚Ä¢ Hexfall, the raid successor to SKT
Things we've made significant progress on:
‚Ä¢ Both overworld replayability features are still being worked
on actively and are growing further to completion. We still
expect both to be out this year
‚Ä¢ The next traditional mainline dungeon, based in Star Point has
had major progress and is looking great
‚Ä¢ 1.20 update is progressing on the build server, but will need
testing before we share anything about updating the play server
What has been pushed out:
‚Ä¢ Work on the next R3 expansion has only begun quite recently.
There are a few reasons for this. The team is low on active
builders, there was significant burnout post Star Point release,
and there was a desire to focus on repolishing some early game
R1 content in order to put our best foot forward for new
players. As a result, we are in the design and ideation phase
for our next expansion, and it will certainly not be ready to
ship this year. We know this is disappointing given we typically
have a sizeable holiday release, but hope the transparency is
appreciated and the team is looking forward to a productive
2025.
Finally, some new stuff coming soon that wasn't on the roadmap:
‚Ä¢ Some exciting new features are coming to Celestial Zenith
later this month
‚Ä¢ A recent development planned for release in the not-too-
distant future, the team has been working hard on a new Strike
set deep below the Architect's Ring! This Strike, conceived as a
spiritual successor to the Sealed Remorse, is the product of a
team-wide development jam hosted in August.
As always, thanks for your patience and support!
&bAttention All Fellow Cleric Players&r
It is with great regret I announce that I messed up the changes
to Divine Justice that were pushed with the latest balance
patch. There was a hotfix to temporarily address the issue but
it should not remain in place for the rest of the month since it
is an unintentional buff to high damage builds while hurting
medium to low damage builds. Therefore, you can expect there to
be another set of changes to Divine Justice and its charms with
this next update that attempt to address these issues.Hey
Monumenta! I'm happy to announce that
&b@Honeypint will be stepping up as Moderator Lead&r! Please
give him lots of üèì üèì !
Mod Leads have the final authority on any moderation issues,
particularly in the small number of cases where players may wish
to contest decisions made to moderators, or with private reports
that players may prefer not to share with the entire mod team.
In 99% of situations, moderation decisions will continue to be
made collectively by the team. See the previous announcement

At the same time, I'll be stepping back from the Mod Lead role
due to being too busy irl. Please continue to give the team and
and our new Mod Lead your support in making Monumenta a great
gaming experience for everyone :)Hey all! It's a great day
because ~~the weekly update is coming~~ we have some new
developers on Team Monumenta! Congratulations to:
@shotoh for their work on a brand new Zenith feature shipping
&otonight&r
@[Sorrow] Michael228p for major contributions to one of the
aforementioned overworld replayability systems in the roadmap
@Potion Seller Enthusiast‚Ñ¢ and @[WOOL] MN for being awesome

the King's Valley the makeover it deserves!
Congratulations! üèìPlease welcome @airtank as our newest

&bImportant:&r
Griefing during the 6 minute wait for World Bosses is no longer
permitted under any circumstances and will result in punishment.
The team would also like to address some of the language being
used within private contexts on the server. Discriminatory and
inappropriate language is not permitted in these contexts, and
will result in punishment. The reason for this is the team does
not wish to foster a culture where it is acceptable to use
discriminatory language.
We'd also like to clarify that having your message blocked by
the chat filter is not considered grounds for an unmute if one
is issued.
