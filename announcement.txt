already demonstrated their abilities on the build shard. If

&bSilver Knight Remnants:&r
Excited to announce that at long last, the mystery of the Crying
Obsidian all around Star Point and the Architect‚Äôs Ring
overworld will finally be solved on <t:1740852000:F> in our
brand new piece of overworld content ‚Ä¢ Silver Knight Remnants.
As part of this new addition to Region 3, you'll find yourself
exploring bite sized sections of places familiar and strange
alike, testing your combat and puzzle capabilities, and giving
the Ring a taste of smaller sized content that was lost with the
introduction of mega-POIs.
Along with its accompanying quest, your journeys into the
Remnants will be supplemented by playing certain R3 Overworld
content (including PoIs, Strikes, Galleries, and bosses) to find
keys to the SKRs, with plenty of rewards to find within!
Players who wish to engage with the Remnants will be able to
find the introductory quest,
&bRemnants of the Empire&r, at the Record-Keeper near the
Chantry of Repentance to learn all about what lies beyond the
hidden Silvergates all over the Ring ‚Ä¢ requiring completion of
For Whom the Bell Tolls, a completion of the Celestial Zenith on
any difficulty, and completion of the world boss Sirius, the
Final Herald.
Please enjoy this teaser trailer, and we hope to see you all
there there! @everyone
https://youtu.be/aADLBZcNT1QSilver Knight Remnants is live! We
hope you all enjoy!Due to issues found during beta testing, this
month's balance update will be delayed until next week to
integrate feedback and add some finishing touches. Thanks for
your patience and understanding.The @ModMail bot is currently
having issues. Please direct any appeals, reports, etc to
Moderators directly for the time being.The @ModMail bot is
working again.
&bDiamenean Hunts&r
Mysterious beasts have been spotted across the Architect's Ring!
Talk to a colorful cast of veteran hunters at the grand opening
of Retneau's Lodge to learn about how to hunt each quarry and
tackle their unique mechanics. Can you successfully hunt them
all down without spoiling the precious loot?
Starting after the weekly update, you can get initiated at the
Lodge in the Wolfswood and gather information on each of the 6
new bosses. The first boss will spawn somewhere in the
Architect's Ring on <t:1742673600:F> (note unusual release time)
and subsequent bosses will spawn periodically after that, with
an average time in between bosses of about 2 hours.
Please note that by the nature of this content, there is
significant downtime between hunts (similar to Treasures of
Viridia). On top of that, due to the mechanics of each boss, it
is possible to have a very low success rate at first (especially
for players who do not read the relevant dialogue from the
veteran hunters). For these reasons, please do
&bnot&r expect this new content to be the primary thing to do,
even on release day.
I hope to see everyone out on the hunting grounds!
@everyone
