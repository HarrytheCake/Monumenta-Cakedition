## Announcing the Closure of the Barrel Bazaar
&bImportant: The player market will continue to remain
operational for the time being. Player and Guild shop stalls
will continue to function as normal.&r
&bIf you currently have unlinked market plugin listings from
before the hotfix, please message a moderator in game to resolve
the issue.&r
Hi all,
The barrel bazaar has seen a ton of use and history since its
opening in February of 2021, mostly for the better. However, as
the server has grown and player wares have diversified, the
barrel bazaar has not kept up ‚Ä¢ its limited space became hotly
contested and the difficulty of searching through it had led to
much player and moderator frustration. Now that the official
market plugin has been stable for several weeks, the moderation
team is taking this opportunity to officially cease operations
of the barrel bazaar in favor of the market plugin.
&nWhat this means for barrel owners and prospective barrel
owners:&r
Your wares are still available and safe. Your barrels have not
been touched at the time of this post. However, the moderation
team encourages you to begin the process of reclaiming any items
and currency you may have, as the barrel bazaar will be closing
soon. For players that were looking to set up a barrel bazaar
shop, we encourage you to instead use the market plugin.
&nWhat this means for shoppers:&r
Hopefully, the market plugin serves your needs significantly
better. We expect that there may be some pushback since the
market filters feature is not yet in place, but rest assured
that it is nearing completing and will be coming out soon.
&bModerators will begin the process of moving barrels to player
plots starting at <t:1713715200>. No additional claims will be
allowed past this time.&r
&bCall for Moderator Applications&r
It's the kinda-semi-annual moderator recruitment drive!

&bUpcoming Hope Skin Change:&r
Hey guys, wanted to make everyone aware of an upcoming change to
the way Hope Skins are obtained ingame that broadens
accessibility. Starting with next week's updates, all Hope Skins
will be fully publicized, meaning they will be purchasable via a
new GUI at Mastersmith Antonio.
What this more broadly means is that in order to Hope Skin an
item (that has one available to be applied), all you will need
is the item is question, and the materials with which to
purchase the infusion. The days of needing to track down a
specific patron in order to have their skin applied to your item
will finally be behind us!
&bRegarding the (most) Recent Ban Wave&r
Hi everyone,
Kaul is one of the game's oldest bosses, and as such he has had
his fair share of bugs and unintended behaviors. One such bug
that has been present for a while has been the ability to
sometimes skip certain forced spell casts. The most deadly of
these is supposed to be his force cast of Volcanic Demise at 10%
of his health. Players, moderators, and developers have been
aware of this bug for quite a while, but only recently was it
discovered that you can consistently reproduce this behavior.
What was once thought to be a somewhat random occurrence has
been exploited by a select group of players for illicit gains
due to increase in Shard of the Mantle prices after the Hope
Skin Rework.
&bThe reason bans were issued was not because of Volcanic Demise
skipping, but due to the concerted effort by a small group of
players who were reliably reproducing the bug, and were actively
and consistently exploiting it without intention of reporting
it.&r
Following further discussions with the moderation team, we will
be unbanning majority of the players initially banned who were
unaware of the circumstances around the skip. We will not punish
anyone who we are not highly certain knew about the exploit but
failed to report it. We will also not be banning any players who
have unintentionally used the bug in previous fights.
Punishments can be appealed by privately messaging a Moderator
on Discord ‚Ä¢ we are trying our best to handle this situation as
fairly as possible.
As always, please directly report any exploits or (suspected)
bugs to a Moderator. Thank you for your help in making Monumenta
a better game experience for the community.
&bAn Update on the Recent Ban Wave&r
Hello,
The decision has been made to lift all remaining punishments
issued in relation to this incident. The team apologizes for any
inconvenience caused by the situation.
&bModmail&r
We have added @ModMail to the server. All issues that require
messaging a Moderator such as appealing a punishment or
reporting an exploit will now be handled through Modmail.
Simply message the bot with your issue and select the Monumenta
Discord Server to open a ticket with Moderators.A note for
founders/managers of guilds ‚Ä¢ with this week's update, you'll
need to grant any guests of your guild access to your guild plot
and/or chat, as by default these permissions are disabled. You
can do so in the guild GUI here, or on a per-guest basis.
&bOpen Call for Quest Dev Applications:&r
Hey everyone, I'd like to take some time to put out an open call
for applications for anyone who is interested in applying to
Team Monumenta as a Quest Developer. Over the years, our quest
team has grown and thinned out fluxuatingly, and we'd like to
expand a bit in order to alleviate work load.
&nFor this application, you:&r
Don't Need:
‚Ä¢ To come in with extensive and exhaustive lore knowledge
‚Ä¢ To have written your own story before
‚Ä¢ To have a deep knowledge of minecraft mechanisms
Need:
‚Ä¢ Willingness to discuss ideas with the quest team and iterate
until a product is worth making
‚Ä¢ Willingness to learn ScriptedQuests and small scale minecraft
commands
‚Ä¢ General good standing with the community as any application
would require
I need to heavily stress the "willingness to learn" part of this
‚Ä¢ Monumenta is driven by people who are motivated to see
something through to the end. This is
&bnot&r a call for people who just want to write lore and
nothing else, but for people who are willing to learn the
systems that drive quest development (the ScriptedQuests
structure, and minecraft commands) and implement their ideas. We
can teach you what you need to know, but you must also have your
own passion for it.
If these conditions fit you, you may apply by directly DM'ing
me, or any other lead, or @Aristotle
