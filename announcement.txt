&bAttention All Fellow Cleric Players&r
It is with great regret I announce that I messed up the changes
to Divine Justice that were pushed with the latest balance
patch. There was a hotfix to temporarily address the issue but
it should not remain in place for the rest of the month since it
is an unintentional buff to high damage builds while hurting
medium to low damage builds. Therefore, you can expect there to
be another set of changes to Divine Justice and its charms with
this next update that attempt to address these issues.Hey
Monumenta! I'm happy to announce that
&b@Honeypint will be stepping up as Moderator Lead&r! Please
give him lots of üèì üèì !
Mod Leads have the final authority on any moderation issues,
particularly in the small number of cases where players may wish
to contest decisions made to moderators, or with private reports
that players may prefer not to share with the entire mod team.
In 99% of situations, moderation decisions will continue to be
made collectively by the team. See the previous announcement
here: https://discord.com/channels/313066655494438922/3134038254

At the same time, I'll be stepping back from the Mod Lead role
due to being too busy irl. Please continue to give the team and
and our new Mod Lead your support in making Monumenta a great
gaming experience for everyone :)Hey all! It's a great day
because ~~the weekly update is coming~~ we have some new

&bImportant:&r
Griefing during the 6 minute wait for World Bosses is no longer
permitted under any circumstances and will result in punishment.
The team would also like to address some of the language being
used within private contexts on the server. Discriminatory and
inappropriate language is not permitted in these contexts, and
will result in punishment. The reason for this is the team does
not wish to foster a culture where it is acceptable to use
discriminatory language.
We'd also like to clarify that having your message blocked by
the chat filter is not considered grounds for an unmute if one
is issued.Hey everyone!
I've been waiting a long time to follow through with this, but
have decided to step officially step down from being a Monumenta
Lead and likely development as whole. I was one of the original
founders of this project and seeing it grow the way it has since
2016 has been one of the most fulfilling things I've ever done.
The way this project and community have grown has exceeded my
wildest expectations. Thank you everyone for being a part of
this whether you're a developer, mod, or player. Everything here
has meant so much to me and I'm excited to see how things
continue on into the future.
I'll be around to be a gremlin as usual every little bit, but
it'll be more as a player more than anything. If you guys see me
around be sure to say hi!Please welcome @whyprophecy as our
newest Moderator! Don't be afraid to üèì
&bZenith Anniversary Event&r
It's been nearly a year since the Celestial Zenith launched on
December 16, 2023, and since then you all have played it

put those dusty leaderboard signs to use. Celebrate the holiday
season and bring your friends between
&bDecember 12&r and
&bDecember 26&r to participate in 6-player Zenith! Times will
approximately be during the standard weekly update time,
depending on the status of the 1.20 content freeze.
Good luck and have fun!6-player Zenith is now live! Best of
luck!Welcome @lynx1240 as your newest moderator!! Please gift
them plenty of üèì
