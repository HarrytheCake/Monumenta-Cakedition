creature.]

  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[I am.]
  You need to kill the first 3 quickly and then use Zirin'kel's levitation arrows to climb up. Or you can use recoil bows from
R2. Keep going either way till you reach the top layer of glass then go up the stairs.

  &5[I'm not sure we can do that. He's sleeping, and waking him up isn't exactly safe either. I've tried. C'Axtal, his
Soulspeaker, is dead, and the new one isn't ready yet.]

 C'Shura
  &6[C'Shura]
 This world has changed greatly in my absence.
  &5[I need to ask you something important.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 Ask then.
  &5[During your time as a Shaman, did you ever share visions with Kaul?]
  &6[C'Shura]
 I did. Why do you need to know this?
  &5[I'm searching for an answer I'm not sure anyone else living knows.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 Who is seeking this knowledge other than you?
  &5[...Oh, A friend.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 ...The wool should not be asking questions of you, [Player]. You should not be following their requests. C'Zanil did. It broke
him.
  &5[It's not like that.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 Of course it's not. It never is. I feel the energy on you. The shape, following you... Did... Did you free one of them? I am
not comfortable continuing this line of conversation.
  &5[Wait, C'Shura, I didn't free anything. I'm trying to put something back into a wool.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 Are you now? Is that what it told you? You would not have that power alone, friend.
  &5[I've seen what he's seen. It's real. He's not trying to hurt anyone.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 Which wool do you refer to? Is it Myrahg? It never did mean any harm...
  &5[Crimson.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 ...
  &6[C'Shura]
 How?
  &5[What do you mean?]
  &6[C'Shura]
 How did it break? The traitorous one, father of the Sons of the Forest, Telsket, took my sister, Shuli, from me. He claimed he
was a Shaman. He claimed he would find a beautiful Crimson. It was all fantasy.
  &5[It wasn't. I've seen what C'Telsket did. He found the Wool and attacked Farr with it, but it broke during the attack.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 And now the being from the wool has come to you. You think you can trust it. I'm sure it whispers in your ear still... Is it
here? The spirit?
  &5[No. He's waiting back in Sierhaven.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 Take me with you. We can try to destroy it together.
  &6[Jeremiah]
 Enough! The Crimson King has been listening through me quietly, but he cannot take it any more. I must speak. C'Shura, [Player]
speaks the truth. I hold within me the creature freed from the Crimson Wool. I voluntarily serve as his conduit and speak his
words by choice. He wishes to tell you: "I was placed within wool for my sins and I wish only to return to my prison from which
I was freed by force. I offer no harm to this world."
  &6[C'Shura]
 Creature, you have no right to enter the halls of Memory. Be. Thee. Gone.
  &6[Jeremiah]
 No right? From where do you think these halls were born? His power echoes through your people's history! These halls are like
home to him!
  &6[C'Shura]
 There is no truth in which you know the old ways, creature. Speak to me directly or not at all!
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &6[C'Shura]
 You... you have no right. This place is protected... You cannot BE here.
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[What are you doing?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &6[C'Shura]
 Ahhhhh!

 I have seen them... In the
  &5[STOP! This isn't okay. If this doesn't stop, now, I'm leaving. I don't owe you anything anymore, and you will not use other
people like this.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &6[C'Shura]
   Oh... the weight. It is gone... No. I cannot let you see... I will succumb anew to his... madness... I will tell you the
words he spoke. Just leave my mind... alone. Never again.
  &5[Never again.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 "Beings formed with vibrant colors once roamed this land. With them came power. In their wake came destruction. These beings
roamed the world and the world was brought to its knees..."
  &6[C'Shura]
 "Eyes fell upon the world and the beings that threatened to end it. Soon, soldiers in shining silver armor emerged, charging
into the fray to match the power of these beings. One by one the beings fell, trapped in prisons matching their being. You know
them as wool."
  &6[C'Shura]
 "Deep in Kaulslund, a temple was constructed. The Knights stood guard over the wool. In time, many were called away and many
more were destroyed, until there was just one left. A lone guardian, slumbering in the darkness."
  &5[Where is the temple?]
  &6[C'Shura]
 I don't know. Time has left that knowledge to rot. Zanil is dead. He knew the truth.
  &5[What if you could speak to him?]
  &6[C'Shura]
 I cannot speak to him. He is dead.
  &5[C'Zanil made a deal with the Crimson King. You can talk to him. Convince him to show us what he knows.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 ...That is disgusting. First you break into my mind, now you offer to puppet the corpse of the disgraced?
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &6[C'Shura]
 So this is why you have come to me. This is why you threaten me in my own shrine.
  &5[If you can't help us, Zanil might be our last chance, and he won't talk. He doesn't trust the Crimson King.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 Clearly Zanil has reason not to trust you. I never want to have my mind violated like this again. But... perhaps Zanil does
still trust me, like I trusted him with Ixume before I left. Fine. Let me see him, so long as you swear by your life that
this... friend of yours will be locked away again.
  &5[I swear it. Take us there please.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
&o  C: Speak to Zanil. Table
 Zanil
  &6[Zanil]
 I see you've returned with a frien- C'Shura?!
  &5[Hello again, Zanil.]
  &6[Zanil]
 How are you here? I thought you were dead in the capital.
  &6[C'Shura]
 You fool. You ignored me. You destroyed our people. You slaughtered thousands and destroyed your very future. Before I came
here I told myself I wouldn't grow angry with you. I was wrong. I am furious, Zanil. You did not listen to me and listened to
the whispers of cruel gods instead. How dare you.
  &6[Zanil]
 How dare I? You gave me Ixume. I did what felt right! I did what had to be done to keep our people alive, while you vanished
into the same corruption that took C'Axtal. It was your war, and I was left alone to lose it.
  &6[C'Shura]
 You fell for their whispers. Sacrificing souls? Warping bodies? You did evil, Zanil.
  &6[Zanil]
 I know. I know why I came here. I could never be disturbed again. Now leave me to suffer my destruction.
  &5[We can not.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 We will not.
  &6[Zanil]
 You must and you will.
  &5[You owe us answers Zanil. Where is the Knight?]
  &6[Zanil]
 You've dragged C'Shura into your delusions? Right after she dares call me out for listening to the whispers of gods?! Do you
even understand what I have done and what has been done to me?
  &5[I know your story. I've followed your path.]
  &6[Zanil]
 Do you? Truly? How the Elders tried to kill me? My exile was not their first choice.
  &6[C'Shura]
 What?!
  &6[Zanil]
 Let me show you...
&o  C: Speak to R'Kitxet. Table
 R'Kitxet
  &6[R'Kitxet]
 Your judgement has been decreed, Zanil. Your title has been stripped. Your wool has been taken.
  &5[I accept your judgement, Elder.]
  &6[R'Kitxet]
 Then it shall be delivered.
  &5[Exile. I know what I deserve.]
  &6[R'Kitxet]
 Nay, Zanil. Death. Stand forth, newly anointed, C'Tnet, and deliver the blow.
  &6[C'Tnet]
 I will do as the Elders command.
  &5[I... I cannot accept this, Elder. This is not the way.]
  &6[R'Kitxet]
 Do you understand what you have done, Zanil? The pain you have caused? The deaths you have reveled in? The war you, and you
alone, have now lost? This is us being merciful.
  &5[No. I cannot. I have so many plans...]
  &6[R'Kitxet]
 Goodbye, Zanil. Your name will forever be a stain upon our people. C'Tnet, if you will...
 After defeating C'Tnet:
&o  C: Speak to Zanil. Table
 Zanil
  &6[Zanil]
 Now you see. I slaughtered their champion. He was intended to replace me. In the chaos, covered in the blood of a Shaman only
trying to protect his people, I fled, my generals at my side. We escaped into a sealed off segment of my Halls and I was
determined that would be my end, exiled.
  &5[You're lucky.]
  &6[Zanil]
 It was not luck. It was fate. Quetzalcoatl and Ixume granting my generals and I one last boon in departure. Or perhaps cursing
me in my leaving.
  &6[C'Shura]
 Enough stalling
  &6[Zanil]
 Fine. For you and you alone. Now listen.
  &6[Zanil]
&o  Deep in Kaulslund, a temple was constructed. The Knights stood guard over the wool. In time, many were called away and many
more were destroyed, until there was just one left. A lone guardian, slumbering in the darkness. It was here that the Jungle saw
an opportunity to protect. Kaul wove a powerful enhancement and cast it upon their temple, hiding it away. Even once that
enchantment was destroyed, the lone guardian remained. He stood guard below the Monument, waiting for the day he would be needed
once more.
  &5[The Monument? It's been there the entire time?]
  &6[Zanil]
 Yes.
  &5[The Crimson King took his wool pedestal from the Monument. He was so close, decades ago.]
  &6[Zanil]
 He could not have entered. Kaul sealed the door so that it would only open when all the wools were contained. You might enter
below where the wools might rest if somehow you have safely placed each wool.
  &5[But how? Crimson is destroyed. The others have been placed there, but surely this is impossible.]
  &6[Zanil]
 Perhaps not. Perhaps your whispering one may still be the key. Be warned. The way to the Slumbering Knight is perilous. Do not
ruin this.
  &5[We won't.]
  &6[Zanil]
 Now, leave me to my memories. Goodbye, Shaman. Goodbye woolbearer.
&o  C: Speak to C'Shura. Table
 C'Shura
  &6[C'Shura]
 So, you have what you need. Both of you. Remind your creature to release his hold on me, [Player].
  &5[What do you mean? Has he not yet?]
  &6[C'Shura]
 I still feel his attack rattling around my head. Little brushes of memory I should not have. I will echo what Zanil said. Do
not ruin this. Put the spirit back into his wool and end this. Do not let him stop you.
  &5[I will. It's what we all want.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 Now go. Return with your spirit and his thrall and plan your steps wisely. Goodbye.

  &6[Jeremiah]
 Hello [Player]. The Crimson King is reaching out into my mind. He is delighted to hear this has worked, but he cannot step off
the Pedestal, as he feared, so long as this place is to remain open. You must approach the Silver Knight alone.
  &5[I am prepared.]

 Be safe, be prepared. I do not know what lies ahead in this maze. I hope we find all the King needs. This has been such a long
time coming.
