 I am not familiar with your ship. Is this your first time visiting these lands?
  &5[It is.]
  &6[Miroku]
 I will not trouble you for why you are here, but are you aware of charms?
  &5[I have been here before.]
  &6[Miroku]
 Interesting. Are you already familiar with our charms?
 Next Choice:
  &5[Yes, I know about charms.]  Plain  (Missing)
  &5[Which type of charm are you referring to?]
  &6[Miroku]
 I suppose a lot of things are called charms...but I'm referring to Charms, a type of item fairly common around these parts that
can be used to strengthen you. Shall I tell you more?
  &5[Maybe later.]
  &6[Miroku]
 I understand. I do hope that you return.
  &5[Please do.]
  &6[Miroku]
 Charms are a powerful type of item commonly found in the Architect Ring. They require between one and five charm slots to
equip. Typically stronger charms require more slots, but a "weaker" charm might be better for your build, so there is a lot of
room for customization.
  &6[Miroku]
 A trained adventurer like yourself would probably be able to use about 9 charm slots. You will gain the ability to use more as
you progress through our lands.
  &6[Miroku]
 Charms can be generic, but most of them revolve around a certain class or specialization.
  &6[Miroku]
 Charms tend to be combat oriented, although non-combatants have at times had ones custom made to help around the house.
  &6[Miroku]
 You can manage your currently equipped charms with a trinket. Just about everyone around here has one. We pretty much just give
them away.
  &5[So what do you want me to do?]
  &6[Miroku]
 I didn't intend for you to do anything, but I suppose I could come up with something if you are interested.
  &5[Thank you for the information.]
  &6[Miroku]
 I do have a proposal for you, if you are interested.
 Next Choice:
  &5[I want to look around more first.]
  &6[Miroku]
 Hopefully you will return shortly. I will give you a charm just for accepting my request.
  &5[What do I need to do?]
  &6[Miroku]
 I want to give you a charm, and the trinket to use it. In return, I ask that you conquer Vibrant Hollow. Obviously, if you do
conquer it, I will have another reward for you.
  &5[That sounds like too much work.]
  &6[Miroku]
 Perhaps, but you could take the charm and just ignore the rest of the quest. I wouldn't get mad or anything.
  &5[I accept]
  &6[Miroku]
 Speak with me again when you are ready to select your charm.

 The time has come for you to make a choice. This isn't a tricky choice so don't worry too much. All I need to know is which
class you intend to conquer the Vibrant Hollow with. I will be more than happy to sell any of them to you once the Vibrant
Hollow are dealt with.

  &5[I am.]
  &6[Miroku]
 (Class) it is then. Here is a trinket and a charm to use with it.
 Receive a Charms Trinket and a charm depending on the class you pick.

 How to reach Mushroom Archmage:
  Clear enough of the PoI to get a message of the miniboss being spawned.

 Then go to [-575 10 -640] in the PoI. (Basement of the large house.)
