   &6[Tybale]
 Hey there [Player]. It's good to see you here. I was actually going to reach out to you and your crew, so it's good you stopped
by.
  &5[What's going on?]
  &6[Tybale]
 Verdanne and I would like to formally invite you and your associates to Conquort's funeral. We've been planning the ceremony
for a few weeks and believe it's important you be able to attend, if you can, and witness the Dichen way of honoring the dead.
  &5[We would be honored to attend.]
  &6[Tybale]
 Wonderful. Could I ask you a favor while you're here, about Conquort?
  &5[Sure thing.]
  &6[Tybale]
 Could you stop by the Galengarde Aboreal Society offices and speak to them about the arrangements for Conquort? They oversee
any special interactions with our home tree, and returning Conquort's remains to it has been a bit of a logistical challenge
with them involved.
  &5[I'll get right on it.]
  &6[Tybale]
 Thank you so much. You're a true friend.

   &6[Martine]
 Salu! Welcome to the Galengarde Arboreal Society! How might I serve you today?
  &5[Hi, I was sent by Primirium Tybale. He said there's been some issues with Conquort's funeral?]
  &6[Martine]
 Oh. Yes. That. You see, we at the Galengarde Arboreal Society have strict laws to follow, even when a member of state is to be
interred.
  &5[So what's causing the issues?]
  &6[Martine]
 Well, the Galengarde Arboreal Society can't allow one to cultivate the great tree, Chenmai, when the tree is being invaded, now
can we?
  &5[I'm sorry, what do you mean "being invaded"?]
  &6[Martine]
 The Galengarde Arboreal Society has detected multiple Mycelian spies. We're not sure quite where they are, but in the wake of
Primirium Conquort's death, the Tree has been sprouting telltale signs of Interceptor Mushrooms. They're watching us.
  &5[Of course... so, what can I do to help ensure this funeral goes smoothly?]
  &6[Martine]
 You'll help then? Splendid. The Galengarde Arboreal Society won't forget your generosity. You can track down the implanted
spies and weed them out.
  &5[Just pick them, or do I need a special material?]
  &6[Martine]
 Any garden variety fungicide should do. The Galengarde Arboreal Society patented one should really do the trick. Here, why
don't you take some?
  &5[Thanks. Now, how do I find these Spyshrooms?]
  &6[Martine]
 Ooh, Spyshrooms. I'll note that down for the Galengarde Arboreal Society records. That's a great name. As for finding them, we
know of three Spyshrooms. There's one on the ground level, one midway up the Tree, and one at the very top. If you get near
enough, the fungicide distributor should give you a little ping.
  &5[I'll get right on it!]
  &6[Martine]
 The Galengarde Arboreal Society appreciates your efforts!
&o  C: Help the Galengarde Aboreal Society by finding the 3 Spyshrooms using the fungicide! If you lost it, Martine will surely
have more.
  Bottom Spyshroom is at [-312 87 -668]
 Middle Spyshroom is at [-326 144 -652] (Right outside library)
 Top Spyshroom is at [-311 183 -649]
 &o  That should be all of the Spyshrooms. Head back to Martine.
&o  C: Return to Martine with the news. Table

 Welcome back to the Galengarde Arboreal Society. Did you find all the Spyshrooms?
  &5[I believe so. It was a bit weird though. Are you sure they're spies?]
  &6[Martine]
 According to all Galengarde Arboreal Society records, no known Mycelia are anything but hostile so... yes. We feel sure.
  &5[But do YOU feel sure?]
  &6[Martine]
 I feel that they were a hostile force like all prior known Mycelia. Anyway, the funeral for Primirium Conquort may progress at
this time. Thank you for your service to the Galengarde Arboreal Society. May he rest well in the roots of Chenmai. Go and
inform his associates that the funeral proceedings will be underway shortly.

 Hello again [Player]. How did it go with the weirdos at the Galengarde Arboreal Society?
  &5[The funeral is cleared to go ahead. There's Mycelian spies sprouting on the tree though. I helped clear some.]
  &6[Tybale]
 Oh. It's actually serious. Hmm, okay. I didn't expect them to have a good reason this time. With Conquort gone, the Mycelia
have been getting bolder. I hope this doesn't spell trouble for the event. Bring your weapons just in case, if you don't mind?
  &5[I will.]
  &6[Tybale]
 Excellent. I'll send invitations to your crew down in the market then. We'll be gathering in a few hours. Please speak with the
Funeral Organizer at the base of the tree and they'll let you into the chambers.

  &6[Rootchanter Ophelie]
 Hello all, and thank you for gracing this chamber with your presence. Tonight, we honor a leader, fallen in the service of
unity. {...}
  &6[Rootchanter Ophelie]
 While in life, Primirium Conquort oversaw the mobilization of troops and the tactics of war, he was a kind man and respected
leader, who's decisive action has helped lead to a future in unity with the Wolfswood. His legacy will be one of peace. His role
will not be easy to fill and his spirit will be missed in Galengarde. {...}
  &6[Rootchanter Ophelie]
 Today, I will be granting him a place eternal in this great city by binding his mortal remains with the great tree that fuels
our continued survival. From nothing we all have come, but into something he will be returned. {...}
  &6[Rootchanter Ophelie]
 Now, I will take his ashes and begin the ceremony that will bind him into the deepest of Chenmai's roots. {...}
  Rootchanter Ophelie begins a complex series of motions as magic begins to swirl. Ashes flow from the nearby urn and glisten in
the air before reaching slowly toward the roots.

  &6[Rootchanter Ophelie]
 Now, he will lay eternal with the myriad of others who have fallen in service of our great home, Galengarde. Now, let us join
hands and-- {...}
