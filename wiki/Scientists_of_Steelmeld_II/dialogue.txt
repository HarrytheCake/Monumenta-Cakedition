 Welcome back, [Player]. Can you hear me?

 Excellent. Once again, I’ll be communicating with you through this intercom. Given your demonstrated ability as one of my top
performing test subjects, we'll be ramping things up today with some new technology right off the bat. Remember, if you get
stuck, the info boxes can give you a hint, and you can take a break at any time!
 Note: Portals can only be placed on smoothstone slab blocks. Left-click for Blue portal, Right-click for Orange portal.
 Pressing the button under the info box by the door:
   &5Launch pads on green blocks will launch you in the direction you are facing!
  Pressing the button under the info box on the third level area left of exit:
   &5Summon a companion cube from its tube by pressing the button. Sneak next to one to pick up or drop it!

 Well done. I hope that launch pad didn't make you too dizzy- there are plenty more in the course. This next level should
require a bit more thinking.
 Pressing the button under the info box right of the exit door:
   &5Remember that you can shoot portals through purple glass as long as they are in the direction you are facing! Some plates
may convert other glass colors to purple while activated.
  Pressing the button under the info box left of the exit door:
   &5When a cube falls on nether wart blocks, it is destroyed. You'll have to find a way to grab it before it falls!
  Solution:

 Nice solve. You don't even want to know what my tech engineers had to go through to make that cube a reality. Anyway, hope you
didn't forget about timers!
 Pressing the button under the info box at start:
   &5Some pressure plates activate timers for purple glass. Make sure to go fast if you're on the clock!

 You really are quite the specimen with that cube. Keep up the good work, and I'll make sure you're rewarded handsomely.

 Uh oh! Looks like you managed to break one of our test chambers. Luckily I managed to pull you out and freeze the chamber just
in time! What could you possibly be thinking doing something like that? Oh well, looks like no dessert for you again. Still,
excellent job passing the tests.
  &5[What do we do now?]
  &6[Professor Bermuda]
 I'll try to repair that broken test room and get back to you when I have a new assignment for you.
  &5[Does that mean I should wait?]
  &6[Professor Bermuda]
 Oh no, you can go and I'll call for you when I have more tests for you to run.
  &5[Can I keep the wand?]
  &6[Professor Bermuda]
 Unfortunately no, but I'll give you another toy to play with instead. Good work!
