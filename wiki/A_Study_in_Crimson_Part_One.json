I f-feel like I broke your trust.\n  &5[I feel like it's time we have a real talk with the Crimson King.]\n  &6[Jeremiah]\n I have a sense you have much understanding now. The King is ready for you, as you are ready for him.  Table\n Jeremiah\n  &6[Jeremiah]\n He returns... I feel his presence on my skin.\n  &5[Wait, is he not inside your head?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  I am not within his head. I am simply myself. I only speak through my herald when it is deemed necessary.\n  &5[Why don't you just speak to me and let Jeremiah go then?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  Let him go? It is an honor to be my herald, [Player]. Sadly it is my curse that I can only speak directly when one is at their\nweakest. I do not sense that to be you to be weak right now, would you agree? Now, to business.\n  &5[Yes. To business. Why do you claim I owe you?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  Of course I claim it. It is my right. Don't you know me [Player]?

Greetings.\n  &5[Hello Nukanm. I sense greatness. Is this so?]\n  &6[Nukanm]\n It is, my Shaman. The resting place has been found. We have discovered what the rest of the Tlaxans have not! The Narsen Empire\nwill finally end.  Table\n Vikusk\n  &6[Vikusk]\n Sir.\n  &5[Vikusk.]\n  &6[Vikusk]\n Do you see it? The structure, jutting from this vile place?

The Sons of the Forest didn't just attack?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[What happened to C'Telsket - er, me?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[Wait, is C\u2019Telsket still alive?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n&o  C: Talk to the Narsen invader child.\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n   Table\n Max\n  &6[Max]\n Hello savage.\n  &5[Hello invader\u2019s spawn.]\n  &6[Max]\n Why... Why did you do it? Do you have any idea of the damage you\u2019ve caused? You murdered Cal! You... He\u2019s gone because of you!\nWHY?!\n  &5[It\u2019s the great cycle of things. Your people invaded my homeland, slaughtered my people. It\u2019s only fitting that we are\nallotted the chance to return that favor. Again, and again, the cycle repeats until there is nothing left but bones and ash.]\n  &6[Max]\n How DARE you talk to me about cycles, after everything you\u2019ve put me through. You\u2019re not human, you\u2019re an animal. A monster\nthat should be put down!\n  &5[I\u2019m no monster. I\u2019m a leader. A leader who had to make hard choices of his allies and his enemies alike. I made promises,\nchild, and I intended to keep them.]\n  &6[Max]\n ...Promises? You murdered Cal. You. He\u2019s gone! You destroyed Farr! You killed dozens of people! You\u2019re fit to lead nothing. You\nknow only violence.\n  &5[...]\n  &5[That is how I have survived thus far.]\n  &6[Max]\n Then maybe you shouldn\u2019t survive any longer. Maybe I should end the cycle...\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  You feel it. The pain in your chest. Blood. The beating of your heart, heavy in your ears. A whispering. The Veil... reaching\nout...\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[...]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[...]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[...]\n  &5[...]\n  &5[Yes.]\n&o  C: Talk to the Crimson King. Table\n Jeremiah (Memory Vault)\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[Why do you need to see it?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n&o  C: Interact with the western effigy in the middle. Table\n Callum's Head\n  &6[Herring]\n Something isn't right here... Max?!\n  &5[Hello?]\n  &6[Herring]\n Come see...\n&o  C: Speak to Max. Table\n Max (Callum's Memory)\n  &6[Max]\n ...Okay, but can't magic work the way I'm wanting it to Professor?\n  &5[Magic is very particular, Max. You can't just brute force it to be what you want. You must convince it. Weave the strands\ntogether like a beautiful tapestry and let the magics cross and form together.]\n  &6[Max]\n So I'm just not convincing enough?\n  &5[Perhaps so.]\n  &6[Max]\n I'll show it then! The magic will listen to me - it must! I need it to!\n  &5[Only when you truly do will you find what you seek.]\n  &6[Max]\n ...I already do, Professor. I'm useless without it.\n  &5[Then do it! Use the magic as you require! Show me your strength.]\n  &6[Max]\n Professor Herring? Who's that over there? Why didn't I notice him before?\n  Max suddenly looks up and seems to spot the Crimson King standing off to the side.\n  &5[What? Who's who?]\n  &6[Max]\n That figure... In the corner there. Sir?\n  &5[I...]\n  &6[Max]\n YOU! I know you! You took him from me! You took Professor Herring! Minerva was missing... We followed... YOU TOOK HIM!\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[What? I'm right here Max. What are you talking about?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[Okay.]\n  &6[Max]\n NO. You will show me what you did!\n&o  C: Defend Farr from the invaders and collect four materials from them that might help track Minerva. Table\n Max (Callum's Memory)\n  &6[Max]\n Professor! I've tracked Minerva here, but I can't tell where that Shaman has taken her next. Something is really wrong though.\nEveryone's hiding. There's Beastmen swarming the streets! We have to help them!\n  &5[I'll start a spell to seek her out. Let's go fight and see if we can find more clues to where they took her!]\n  &6[Max]\n Great idea Professor. Let me know what you find and we can track her down together. There seems to be four types of invaders to\nhandle.\n  Note: It can take quite a few kills to get the item you need. (It is around 1/10 chance). The mobs spawn around magma blocks.\n Depleted Crystal is dropped from Serpensia Knots which are located directly west of Max. (797, 195, 490).\n Crimson Scraps is dropped from Invader of the Forest which are located in and around the North West corner of Farr. (795, 190,\n437)\n Muddied Parchment is dropped from Serpensia Venomlords which are located directly East of Max. (881, 192, 508)\n Bloodied Leathers is dropped from Serpensia Warriors which are located in the river area North East of Max. (863, 194, 462)\n  Max (Callum's Memory)\n  &6[Max]\n Professor, I think we've found out where Minerva is! The clues you found helped narrow the spell. We'll need to head out into\nthe forest...\n  Together, you and Max fled the besieged city. In the forest however, you were attacked by an acolyte of C'Telsket. You awoke\nwithin his lair...\n&o  C: Desperately try to defeat C'Telsket.\n After defeating C'Telsket:\n&o  C: Talk to the Crimson King.

Table\n Zanil's Head\n  &6[Zanil]\n It is time. I will embrace the great tapestry...\n&o  C: Talk to the Crimson King. Table\n Jeremiah (Zanil's Memory)\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[What did you learn?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[Not a single one?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[Wait, have you never looked into his memories?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[I am.]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n&o  C: Talk to Zanil. Table\n Zanil (Zanil's Memory)\n  &6[Zanil]\n Are you the Crimson King? Do you come to taunt me further with promises of freedom?\n  &5[I am not. My name is [Player], I have been sent here to speak to you.]\n  &6[Zanil]\n Of course. He sends another to do his work. He wants what I know.\n  &5[And what do you know, Zanil?]\n  &6[Zanil]\n I know where the Slumbering Knight lies. The King will need him to return home. I do not trust his motivations, however. If he\nfinds the Slumbering Knight, he could kill him and be one step closer to being free forever. Spirits lie, [Player].\n  &5[How can I convince you?]\n  &6[Zanil]\n You can't. The Crimson King is not what you think he is.\n  &5[I know what he is. He's a being that was trapped inside the Crimson Wool.]\n  &6[Zanil]\n There is so much more to it than that. Let me show you something I have not shown the King. They whisper, you know. The Wool. I\ncan feel their stain on your hands. Ixume chose its bearer when it was done with its previous one. I'm sure it chose you too.\n  &5[Then show me.]\n  &6[Zanil]\n I shall.\n&o  C: Explore Zanil's memory. Table\n C'Shura (Zanil's Memory)\n  &6[C'Shura]\n You came, Zanil.\n  &5[I did.]\n  &6[C'Shura]\n I have need of you.\n  &5[I know. That is why I came.]\n  &6[C'Shura]\n I am being told to pay for my mistakes. I started this war. Now Axtal is gone and the city is sealed.\n  &5[I fear for you.]\n  &6[C'Shura]\n I fear for me as well. When I open the fountain, I do not know if I can hold the corruption back. You will need to be far from\nhere.\n  &5[But you needed me here first.]\n  &6[C'Shura]\n I must give you Ixume. They cannot come with me. Should I fall to what Kaul has left behind, our people cannot afford to lose a\nGod too.\n  &5[I will care for our God with my lifeblood, Shaman. The Elders are risking it all.]\n  &6[C'Shura]\n I know. But I must do my duty and withstand what Kaul will show me. Now, take it. Leave this place.\n  &5[Thank you.]\n  &6[C'Shura]\n Goodbye. Perhaps we will see each other again someday.\n  &5[Perhaps.]\n  &6[C'Shura]\n  &5[What?]\n  &6[C'Shura]\n I didn't say anything. Leave here Shaman. Now. Don't let the whispers get too loud...\n&o  C: Speak to Zanil again. Table\n Zanil (Zanil's Memory)\n  &6[Zanil]\n You see. It spoke. It never stopped speaking. How C'Shura kept it suppressed I did not understand. Together with Quetzalcoatl,\nwe did great things... Great and hideous things... But these spirits cannot be trusted. Now, I bid you leave. If you insist on\nhelping him, find another way. I will not share.\n  &5[Farewell.]\n  &6[Zanil]\n Goodbye woolbearer. Don't let the voices get too loud...\n&o  C: Talk to the Crimson King. Table\n Jeremiah (Memory Vault)\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[Not entirely.]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[He showed me when C'Shura granted him the Orange Wool. It spoke to him.]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[Zanil also told me not to trust you.]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[Then we need to find another way. Zanil says he knows where the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Slumbering Knight\u00e2\u20ac? is.]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[I'm sorry, I don't know.]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[Is there anything else you can think of?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[Wait!]\n  &6[Jeremiah]\n Ahh... the dream has ended. Hello again [Player]. I sense the King has stepped away for some time to think.\n  &5[I don't understand. This isn't the end. There's still more we can do!]\n  &6[Jeremiah]\n When he is ready to share the darkness he has fostered with you, I am sure he will. For now, all you can do is wait. Thank you\nfor your service. You will be required again.\n  '''A STUDY IN CRIMSON PART 1 COMPLETE!'''\n  Awarded the Crimson Contract and 5 Hyperexperience.\n", "reward": "rewards =\n* 5 HXP\n* &3Crimson Contract&r\n"}
