 &o  He's talking to himself.
  &6[Lincoln]&r
 Ugh, this client again? Why does he always order so many rare fish? It's such a pain...
  &5[Hello crazy person talking to himself!]&r
  &6[Lincoln]&r
 Well, there's no need to be rude.
  &5[Hello!]&r
  &6[Lincoln]&r
 Are you here to order something annoying too?
  &5[Yes, I'll have two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and
a large soda.]&r
  &6[Lincoln]&r
 Go away. Plain  ''He gives you a stern look. That obviously wasn't on the menu.
  &5[No, I was just stopping by to see if you needed anything.]&r
  &6[Lincoln]&r
 Oh, I see. Why yes- you see this client I have is looking for some pain-in-the-arse-to-fetch fish. And I know exactly where to
find it...the Sunken Ship to the southwest. This species of Salmon love to hide in wrecks.
 C:   &o  Travel to the   Link   Sunken Ship Sunken_Ship wikilink to obtain the Salmon for Lincoln's client.
 After getting the Salmon:
 C:   &o  [1/2]: Return to Lincoln with the Salmon.
 C:   &o  [2/2]: If you lose the Salmon you can find another at the Sunken Ship.

  &6[Lincoln]&r
 Ah! You've found it. Perfect...
  &5[You're acting pretty creepy about this.]&r
  &6[Lincoln]&r
 I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you.
  &5[It's okay. What do I need to do next?]&r
  &6[Lincoln]&r
 It's simple: just deliver the fish to my client! He should be in the park in front of the Brig.
&o  He rubs his hands together excitedly.
 C:   &o  [1/2]: Deliver the Salmon to the client by the Mistport Brig.
 C:   &o  [2/2]: If you lose the Salmon you can find another at the Sunken Ship.

 I hope my delivery comes soon- I was looking to cook up something fishy for dinner tonight...
  &5[Why yes, your delivery has come!]&r
  &6[Alton]&r
 Ah! Perfect! I assume you've brought the fish?
  &5[Yep, here it is.]&r
  &6[Alton]&r
 Hmm... It looks a little odd for a salmon, but I'm sure it'll taste just fine! I trust Lincoln. Give him my thanks!
 C:   &o  Return to Lincoln
 Lincoln
  &6[Lincoln]&r
 Have you delivered the fish?
  &5[Yes, I have! Alton seems quite pleased- he was looking forward to having it for dinner.]&r
  &6[Lincoln]&r
 Perfect! Now I'll never have to deal with him again!
&o  He looks at you nervously.
  &5[Excuse me?]&r
  &6[Lincoln]&r
 Uh... did I say that out loud?
  &5[What was that fish I gave him?]&r
  &6[Lincoln]&r
 Oh come on! Don't tell me you didn't notice: it was obviously a pufferfish! Look, how about I give you some compensation for
your work and your silence...
