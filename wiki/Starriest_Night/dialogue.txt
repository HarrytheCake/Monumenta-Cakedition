   &6[Maywitch]
 Well, hello there! I'm quite surprised someone found me in this maze of a city.
  &5[Hello. What are you doing up here?]
  &6[Maywitch]
 Me? Nothing suspicious, mind you. I'm... stargazing. At least trying to. It's a difficult task, especially when your telescope
is all sorts of broken.
  &5[Your telescope is broken? Mind if I take a look? I have quite a history with these devices.]
  &6[Maywitch]
 I... wow, yeah, you seem like someone who knows what they're doing. Actually... Plain &o  She gazes towards the sky for a short
moment, before looking back at you. She continues with a slight hesitance..
  &6[Maywitch]
 I think I wouldn't mind if you help me a little. See, I need calibration tools. Rather unusual calibration tools, found in
unusual places.
  &5[I'm all ears.]
  &6[Maywitch]
 Alright, good. Glad I didn't scare you off. So, first I'll need a Cloudpiercer Fork from   Link   Cloud Piercer Cloud_Piercer
wikilink  , then I'll need... Plain &o  A sudden numbness overwhelms you, your vision clouds up, and a sinister sound rings in
your head.
  &6[Maywitch]
 ...Starblight Diagonal from   Link   Bastion of Spires Bastion_of_Spires wikilink  , and an Andromeda Clamp from   Link
Aphelion Isle Aphelion_Isle wikilink  . Those'll be enough.
  &5[I... Yes. I got it.]
  &6[Maywitch]
 Perfect! You're really helping me out here. I'll be able to stargaze again very soon!
  &6[Maywitch]
 Fine... Come back when you feel better, I'll remind you what you need to bring.
  &5[Unusual places? I have a bad record with those. I'd better stay out of this place.]
  &6[Maywitch]
 Alright. Just let me know if you change your mind.
  &5[I wandered up here by accident, I'll be going now.]
  &6[Maywitch]
 Okay then...
&o  [1/4]: Find a Cloudpiercer Fork at   Link   Cloud Piercer Cloud_Piercer wikilink  .
&o  [2/4]: Find a Starblight Diagonal at   Link   Bastion of Spires Bastion_of_Spires wikilink  .
&o  [3/4]: Find an Andromeda Clamp on   Link   Aphelion Isle Aphelion_Isle wikilink  .
&o  [4/4]: Once you found all items, return to Maywitch in Oceangate.
  Cloudpiercer Fork can be found at [-1538, 133, -266].
 Starblight Diagonal can be found at [-1366, 140, -261].
 Andromeda Clamp can be found at [-1518, 106, 399].

  &6[Maywitch]
 You came back, I see. Do you have the tools?
  &5[I do. They almost cost me my life. I probably even died a couple of times... Here, take them.]]
  &6[Maywitch]
 At least your sense of humor is still alive and well. Anyway, thanks for bringing these to me. Now, I just need to stitch them
together...
&o  She reaches her hand into her pocket, searching for something.
  &6[Maywitch]
 Just a moment, please...
&o  Moments later, she pulls a strange blue adhesive out of her pocket.
  &6[Maywitch]
 There it is! Now, put some around the base... like that... yes, then another round...
&o  That clearly is not the way it should look.
  &6[Maywitch]
 Damn it. I can't do this. I can't leave the telescope either. Sorry, but I must ask for your help again. Please, I need you to
go to Orion. He is a... friend of mine, so to speak. Seek out a spire near an abandoned laboratory filled with toxins, he should
be at the top.
&o  Find Orion at the top of a strange spire-like structure near the   Link   Toxin Lab Toxin_Lab wikilink  . Table
 Orion
  Coordinates: [-1188, 120, 179]
   &6[Orion]
 The stars spoke to me again. They said you would come to see me.
  &5[Uh huh. Right, the stars. I assume the stars also told you why I'm here?]
  &6[Orion]
 I know why. She sent you, I know that too. Give me the parts, I shall unite them.
  &5[This is weird. You're weird. And scary. I'd better go.]
  &6[Orion]
 The sky yearns to be set free. You will come back...
  &5[(Give him the parts)]
&o  He takes the parts from your hands. With an unbelievable subtlety, he pieces them together, forming a strange device and
gives it back to you.
  &6[Orion]
 Now, go forth and behold the depths.
&o  Return to Maywitch with the device. Table
 Maywitch
  &6[Maywitch]
 Hello! I assume you've visited Orion?
  &5[That I did. Here's your mechanism, repaired.]]
&o  She puts the mechanism into a side panel of the telescope.
  &6[Maywitch]
 Finally! I'm able to stargaze once again! Let me fix it real quick.
  &5[Is it working?]]
  &6[Maywitch]
 Yes, indeed!
&o  She moves over to the telescope and peeks through it.
  &6[Maywitch]
 And the beacon has been lit. Aurora is close, I can almost feel it.
  &5[What? Aurora? I... Mind if I look too?]]
  &6[Maywitch]
 Ugh, yes, I suppose you can, you've helped me after all..
  &5[(Look into the telescope)]]
  Color|orange|[???]
 Follow the lights. Let your soul embrace the stars, or be forever submerged in an eternal nightmare.
  Color|orange|[???]
 Let them wander...

  &6[Maywitch]
 You okay there? You look like you've seen something terrifying.
  &5[What... what happened? What was that?]
  &6[Maywitch]
 Hm? So you did see something? That's intriguing... Tell me, what did you see?
  &5[I was here and... I suddenly found myself in a dark place, alone on a small floating isle, surrounded by nothing but boid.]
  &6[Maywitch]
 That's all?
  &5[No, I had to walk through the endless nothingness towards a huge temple, and a strange voice echoed in my ears, saying
ominous things.]
  &6[Maywitch]
 What happened then? Did you reach the end?
  &5[I did. I strangely felt pulled towards a light, and I jumped into it.]
  &6[Maywitch]
 ange things happen all the time with the stars, [Player]. What matters is what you do with the visions.
  &6[Maywitch]
 This is... not something to be taken lightly. You need to see it yourself. The beacon has been lit, I can finally see. Head
towards its fumes northeast of here, this is a sign [Player]
&o  She sighs.
  &5[Where exactly am I heading?]
  &6[Maywitch]
 A lone isle north-west of Sierhaven. I heard the King sent an expedition there... I don't know what to expect, but stay on your
guard.
&o  Head towards the strange island in the northern parts of Narsen Sea. Table
 Professor Marl
  Coordinates: [-1077, 83, -353]
   &6[Professor Marl]
 Hm... the door looks very old... it seems that this crypt was built way before our expedition to this land... I wonder how long
it has been here...
&o  He seems to ignore your presence.
  &5[You must be Professor Marl, right?]
  &6[Professor Marl]
 Why is it still standing with all those bandits around... perhaps it's something else?
&o  He continues to ignore you.
  &5[*Snap your fingers to get his attention*]
  &6[Professor Marl]
 Why is it still standing with all those bandits around... perhaps it's something else?
  &5[You're Professor Marl, right?]
  &6[Professor Marl]
 That I am! I was born in Sierhaven and studied geology there. For much of my life I traveled across the valley, but that meant
putting myself at risk. I eventually retired from field research. For the last five years I have worked in Sierhaven,
researching the rocks gathered from the cliffs of the Valley, and helping to train the next generation of geologists.
  &5[What is this place?]
  &6[Professor Marl]
 I'm... not sure. When we arrived here, there was nothing but ruins. We had to set up camp and dig through the collapsed
basement. That's how we found the gate.
  &5[What are you doing here?]
  &6[Professor Marl]
 You must have spotted that small tower on the surface, the one with the fire, the diorite beacon? It has been unlit for
decades! While on a mission, one of the scouts spotted that fire and reported it to the king. He sent an expedition to figure
out what caused the change.
  &5[And then you found this door?]
  &6[Professor Marl]
 Exactly! Whatever caused the beacon to light up again, must be behind this door. However, it's locked. We can't go through just
yet, but I'm sure it's just a matter of time. I'm already developing a solution.
  &5[I need to get inside somehow. Any ideas?]
  Color|orange|[Professor Marl]
 I'm afraid I can't be much of a help there, young one. Not only do we not know how to open it, but the King has also given
clear orders - do not let anyone inside.
  &5[Excuse me, Professor, but I really ne--]
&o  Suddenly, you hear a ringing in your head and a bright light envelops you. After a few moments, you find yourself in a
strange room.
  &6[???]
 I...      see you...
  &6[???]
 I... am      apart...
  &6[???]
   beyond repair...

 Sent there...      the realm...

 Oh, it's you, [Player]. Did you find anything?
  Color|purple|[I did. I didn't know what happened, but I went to the beacon and then...]
  &6[Maywitch]
 And then?
  Color|purple|[...Something strange happened. I found myself in the void again, a giant temple stood before me.]
  &6[Maywitch]
 A temple? Interesting...
  Color|purple|[Deep inside that temple, I found a dead comet, and this shard inside of it.]
  &6[Maywitch]
 Fascinating. I never dreamed of seeing a shard of Andromeda... I am eternally grateful, [Player]. Please, take this. Know, that
today you helped the stargazers. The blessing of the stars shall be upon you.
