 Welcome, welcome. I can sell you items of a particularly pyromaniacal nature, but first, a question! Look behind me at my
collection, and tell me - what am I missing?
  &5[More rocks?]
  &5[Sanity?]
  &5[Umm...]
  &6[Carbocius]
 Ha, brilliant! Of course, I didn't hear you, but I'm sure it was a fine guess. The answer is, of course, new samples! My
collection of pyroclastic flows is drying up, and requires new samples from the geologic features nearby. What do you say, old
chum, think you could dig up three fresh magma samples?
  &5[Sure, I like geology.]
  &5[I don't think so.]
  &6[Carbocius]
 Ah ha, I think I just heard an enthusiastic "yes"! Brilliant, old chap, it's great to see that passion for geology still runs
rampant! Three magma samples from three different geologic features. Bring them here quick before they harden, chop chop.

 Ha, brilliant! Look at those dolerite inclusions, simply beautiful. Here, have these. It occurs to me you might have preferred
this before acquiring these samples, but look at these extrusive patterns!
