   &6[Jeremiah]
 I'm sorry... I f-feel like I broke your trust.
  &5[I feel like it's time we have a real talk with the Crimson King.]
  &6[Jeremiah]
 I have a sense you have much understanding now. The King is ready for you, as you are ready for him.  Table
 Jeremiah
  &6[Jeremiah]
 He returns... I feel his presence on my skin.
  &5[Wait, is he not inside your head?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  I am not within his head. I am simply myself. I only speak through my herald when it is deemed necessary.
  &5[Why don't you just speak to me and let Jeremiah go then?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  Let him go? It is an honor to be my herald, [Player]. Sadly it is my curse that I can only speak directly when one is at their
weakest. I do not sense that to be you to be weak right now, would you agree? Now, to business.
  &5[Yes. To business. Why do you claim I owe you?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  Of course I claim it. It is my right. Don't you know me [Player]? Do you not remember my caress as death approached?
  &5[No, I don't.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
&o  C: Talk to the Crimson King. Table

  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Why do you think that?]

  &5[Where is your home?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[I can't help you.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[I'll help you.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  Color|red|Of course you will. It was not a request. Now, let us return to the Memory Vault, where we can begin...
&o  C: Talk to the Crimson King. Table

  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[How does this work?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Where do I begin?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
&o  C: Leave the Memory Vault.
 After leaving the Memory Vault:
&o  C: Interact with the western effigy closest to the Memory Vault. Table
 Telsket Head
  &5[This must be the effigy. The King said it would take me into the Ephemeral Corridors...]
 ...yes... this place has power...
  &5[Hello? Is someone there?]
 ...we will find the way...
&o  C: Explore the memory. Table
 Tkisali
  &6[Tkisali]
 Lord Shaman. Greetings.
  &5[Hello Tkisali. What have your men discovered?]
  &6[Tkisali]
 The resting place. It is here. Our time has come, C'Telsket. The Sons of the Forest will rise anew!  Table
 Nukanm
  &6[Nukanm]
 Lord Shaman. Greetings.
  &5[Hello Nukanm. I sense greatness. Is this so?]
  &6[Nukanm]
 It is, my Shaman. The resting place has been found. We have discovered what the rest of the Tlaxans have not! The Narsen Empire
will finally end.  Table
 Vikusk
  &6[Vikusk]
 Sir.
  &5[Vikusk.]
  &6[Vikusk]
 Do you see it? The structure, jutting from this vile place? Myrahg would never even touch this vile infestation.
  &5[I see it clearly.]
  &6[Vikusk]
 Then it is time, is it not? Let us descend within, and claim what should have been ours, Lord Shaman.  Header section

  &6[The Crimson King]
  Greetings C’Telsket, first of the Soulseekers. Your journey has reached a vital moment.
  &5[Excuse me?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[I've been here before.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[I am not, I need to prepare myself.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[I am.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  Then enter the Corridors.
&o  C: Delve into C'Telsket's memory of the Ephemeral Corridors.

section in front of the ladder and up the next ladder.)

  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Are you sure? This is the Arena of Terth in Sierhaven.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[I don’t know.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Who is that?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Who?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
&o  C: Destroy the Narsen invader.

  &5[Wait, that's what happened to Farr? The Sons of the Forest didn't just attack?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[What happened to C'Telsket - er, me?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Wait, is C’Telsket still alive?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
&o  C: Talk to the Narsen invader child.
  &6[The Crimson King]
   Table
 Max
  &6[Max]
 Hello savage.
  &5[Hello invader’s spawn.]
  &6[Max]
 Why... Why did you do it? Do you have any idea of the damage you’ve caused? You murdered Cal! You... He’s gone because of you!
WHY?!
  &5[It’s the great cycle of things. Your people invaded my homeland, slaughtered my people. It’s only fitting that we are
allotted the chance to return that favor. Again, and again, the cycle repeats until there is nothing left but bones and ash.]
  &6[Max]
 How DARE you talk to me about cycles, after everything you’ve put me through. You’re not human, you’re an animal. A monster
that should be put down!
  &5[I’m no monster. I’m a leader. A leader who had to make hard choices of his allies and his enemies alike. I made promises,
child, and I intended to keep them.]
  &6[Max]
 ...Promises? You murdered Cal. You. He’s gone! You destroyed Farr! You killed dozens of people! You’re fit to lead nothing. You
know only violence.
  &5[...]
  &5[That is how I have survived thus far.]
  &6[Max]
 Then maybe you shouldn’t survive any longer. Maybe I should end the cycle...
  &6[The Crimson King]
  You feel it. The pain in your chest. Blood. The beating of your heart, heavy in your ears. A whispering. The Veil... reaching
out...
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[...]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[...]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[...]
  &5[...]
  &5[Yes.]
&o  C: Talk to the Crimson King. Table
 Jeremiah (Memory Vault)
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Why do you need to see it?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
&o  C: Interact with the western effigy in the middle. Table
 Callum's Head
  &6[Herring]
 Something isn't right here... Max?!
  &5[Hello?]
  &6[Herring]
 Come see...
&o  C: Speak to Max. Table
 Max (Callum's Memory)
  &6[Max]
 ...Okay, but can't magic work the way I'm wanting it to Professor?
  &5[Magic is very particular, Max. You can't just brute force it to be what you want. You must convince it. Weave the strands
together like a beautiful tapestry and let the magics cross and form together.]
  &6[Max]
 So I'm just not convincing enough?
  &5[Perhaps so.]
  &6[Max]
 I'll show it then! The magic will listen to me - it must! I need it to!
  &5[Only when you truly do will you find what you seek.]
  &6[Max]
 ...I already do, Professor. I'm useless without it.
  &5[Then do it! Use the magic as you require! Show me your strength.]
  &6[Max]
 Professor Herring? Who's that over there? Why didn't I notice him before?
  Max suddenly looks up and seems to spot the Crimson King standing off to the side.
  &5[What? Who's who?]
  &6[Max]
 That figure... In the corner there. Sir?
  &5[I...]
  &6[Max]
 YOU! I know you! You took him from me! You took Professor Herring! Minerva was missing... We followed... YOU TOOK HIM!
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[What? I'm right here Max. What are you talking about?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Okay.]
  &6[Max]
 NO. You will show me what you did!
&o  C: Defend Farr from the invaders and collect four materials from them that might help track Minerva. Table
 Max (Callum's Memory)
  &6[Max]
 Professor! I've tracked Minerva here, but I can't tell where that Shaman has taken her next. Something is really wrong though.
Everyone's hiding. There's Beastmen swarming the streets! We have to help them!
  &5[I'll start a spell to seek her out. Let's go fight and see if we can find more clues to where they took her!]
  &6[Max]
 Great idea Professor. Let me know what you find and we can track her down together. There seems to be four types of invaders to
handle.
  Note: It can take quite a few kills to get the item you need. (It is around 1/10 chance). The mobs spawn around magma blocks.
 Depleted Crystal is dropped from Serpensia Knots which are located directly west of Max. (797, 195, 490).
 Crimson Scraps is dropped from Invader of the Forest which are located in and around the North West corner of Farr. (795, 190,
437)
 Muddied Parchment is dropped from Serpensia Venomlords which are located directly East of Max. (881, 192, 508)
 Bloodied Leathers is dropped from Serpensia Warriors which are located in the river area North East of Max. (863, 194, 462)
  Max (Callum's Memory)
  &6[Max]
 Professor, I think we've found out where Minerva is! The clues you found helped narrow the spell. We'll need to head out into
the forest...
  Together, you and Max fled the besieged city. In the forest however, you were attacked by an acolyte of C'Telsket. You awoke
within his lair...
&o  C: Desperately try to defeat C'Telsket.
 After defeating C'Telsket:
&o  C: Talk to the Crimson King. Table

  &5[Did we learn anything new?]

&o  C: Leave the Memory Vault.
&o  C: Interact with the eastern effigy closest to the Memory Vault. Table
 Zanil's Head
  &6[Zanil]
 It is time. I will embrace the great tapestry...
&o  C: Talk to the Crimson King. Table
 Jeremiah (Zanil's Memory)
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[What did you learn?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Not a single one?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Wait, have you never looked into his memories?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[I am.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
&o  C: Talk to Zanil. Table
 Zanil (Zanil's Memory)
  &6[Zanil]
 Are you the Crimson King? Do you come to taunt me further with promises of freedom?
  &5[I am not. My name is [Player], I have been sent here to speak to you.]
  &6[Zanil]
 Of course. He sends another to do his work. He wants what I know.
  &5[And what do you know, Zanil?]
  &6[Zanil]
 I know where the Slumbering Knight lies. The King will need him to return home. I do not trust his motivations, however. If he
finds the Slumbering Knight, he could kill him and be one step closer to being free forever. Spirits lie, [Player].
  &5[How can I convince you?]
  &6[Zanil]
 You can't. The Crimson King is not what you think he is.
  &5[I know what he is. He's a being that was trapped inside the Crimson Wool.]
  &6[Zanil]
 There is so much more to it than that. Let me show you something I have not shown the King. They whisper, you know. The Wool. I
can feel their stain on your hands. Ixume chose its bearer when it was done with its previous one. I'm sure it chose you too.
  &5[Then show me.]
  &6[Zanil]
 I shall.
&o  C: Explore Zanil's memory. Table
 C'Shura (Zanil's Memory)
  &6[C'Shura]
 You came, Zanil.
  &5[I did.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 I have need of you.
  &5[I know. That is why I came.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 I am being told to pay for my mistakes. I started this war. Now Axtal is gone and the city is sealed.
  &5[I fear for you.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 I fear for me as well. When I open the fountain, I do not know if I can hold the corruption back. You will need to be far from
here.
  &5[But you needed me here first.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 I must give you Ixume. They cannot come with me. Should I fall to what Kaul has left behind, our people cannot afford to lose a
God too.
  &5[I will care for our God with my lifeblood, Shaman. The Elders are risking it all.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 I know. But I must do my duty and withstand what Kaul will show me. Now, take it. Leave this place.
  &5[Thank you.]
  &6[C'Shura]
 Goodbye. Perhaps we will see each other again someday.
  &5[Perhaps.]
  &6[C'Shura]
  &5[What?]
  &6[C'Shura]
 I didn't say anything. Leave here Shaman. Now. Don't let the whispers get too loud...
&o  C: Speak to Zanil again. Table
 Zanil (Zanil's Memory)
  &6[Zanil]
 You see. It spoke. It never stopped speaking. How C'Shura kept it suppressed I did not understand. Together with Quetzalcoatl,
we did great things... Great and hideous things... But these spirits cannot be trusted. Now, I bid you leave. If you insist on
helping him, find another way. I will not share.
  &5[Farewell.]
  &6[Zanil]
 Goodbye woolbearer. Don't let the voices get too loud...
&o  C: Talk to the Crimson King. Table
 Jeremiah (Memory Vault)
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Not entirely.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[He showed me when C'Shura granted him the Orange Wool. It spoke to him.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Zanil also told me not to trust you.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Then we need to find another way. Zanil says he knows where the â€œSlumbering Knightâ€? is.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[I'm sorry, I don't know.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Is there anything else you can think of?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Wait!]
  &6[Jeremiah]
 Ahh... the dream has ended. Hello again [Player]. I sense the King has stepped away for some time to think.
  &5[I don't understand. This isn't the end. There's still more we can do!]
  &6[Jeremiah]
 When he is ready to share the darkness he has fostered with you, I am sure he will. For now, all you can do is wait. Thank you
for your service. You will be required again.
