 Hi, do you have some free time? My telescope has broken and I have need of assistance. Of course, I will be compensating you
for your time.

 Thank you for helping! And here, a fellow lover of the skies deserves these to keep seeing things in the distance!

 Anyway, I am not from around here and so the guard thought I was a spy and took my telescope lens! A man named Ed offered to
get it back, but I could not afford his price. He was down in an alley by the river, would you please talk to him and find a way
into the armory?
  Color|Purple|[Some other time.]

 I see. That is most alright. Perhaps I will seek out a Star Acolyte to assist me.
&o  [1/3]: Mayleen's telescope lens was taken, but a man named Ed might know a way to get it back. Look for him on the south
side of Nyr.
&o  [2/3]: Use the Thief's Guide: Nyr to find a way into the Nyr Armory.
&o  [3/3]: Return to Mayleen once you have the lens.
 NOTE: It is optional to buy the Thief's Guide: Nyr from Scarface Ed [-137, 91, -1]. Costs 12 Xp.
 To get into the armory.
  Press the stone button near the Tavern at at [-124, 96, -116] to open the Armory door.

 This is splendid! You got my lens! I will start repairing the main body while you head downstairs to fix the gearing! When all
the lights face towards you, the telescope will be ready.
&o  Mayleen's telescope just needs to be turned now. Align all the lights in her tower to fix the telescope. Header
