   &6[Captain Argoun]&r
 Hello [Player]! I've heard you've managed to complete the Monument behind Highwatch. That's absolutely brilliant!
  &5[It was nothing, really.]&r
  &5[Yes, it took a great deal of effort.]&r
  &6[Captain Argoun]&r
 I could actually use your help, if you wouldn't mind.
  &5[I still have things to attend to in the Valley.]&r
  &6[Captain Argoun]&r
 Alright, well please come back when you get the chance.
  &5[What is it?]&r
  &6[Captain Argoun]&r
 Captain Indigo has been pushing to get a permit to leave the King's Valley, but we aren't too keen to give permission to
such... unsavory characters. You've helped her out before, would you vouch for her permit?
  &5[Pirates don't have rights.]&r
  &6[Captain Argoun]&r
 That might be a bit exaggerated, but I get your point. I'm still not sure, so if you change your mind I'll be here.
  &5[Captain Indigo is of no danger.]&r
  &6[Captain Argoun]&r
 I was starting to lean that way as well. Alright, I'm convinced! You can go let Captain Indigo know she is all set to sail
through the Seagate.
&o  Tell Indigo she has been cleared to pass through the seagate.
 Captain Indigo
  &6[Captain Indigo]&r
 Ahoy [Player]! We're all itching to set sail soon. Hopefully our permit will be approved soon.
  &5[Good news! It's been approved.]&r
  &6[Captain Indigo]&r
 That is amazing news! We're all ready to take off here, would you care to join us on our maiden voyage?
  &5[Where are you sailing to?]&r
  &6[Captain Indigo]&r
 We'll be headed to the haven of pirates, the   Link   Celsian Isles Celsian_Isles wikilink  . There, we'll find treasures
galore in the Viridian region!
  &5[I think I prefer land for now.]&r
  &6[Captain Indigo]&r
 Arrgh! Return quickly if you change your mind.
  &5[Absolutely.]&r
 /     &5[Alright, I'm in.]&r
  &6[Captain Indigo]&r
 Are you ready to set sail?
  &5[Arrgh!]&r
  &6[Captain Indigo]&r
 ARRGH!
 C:   &o  Talk to Captain Indigo.
 Captain Indigo
  &6[Captain Indigo]&r
 Ahoy [Player]! The sea is beautiful today, don't you think so?
  &5[I think I'm going to be sick.]&r
  &6[Captain Indigo]&r
 Ha- after you're done hurling off the starboard you should check in with Izzy to see where we are.
  &5[We should just stay on the sea forever.]&r
  &6[Captain Indigo]&r
 Well, we'll need to reach port eventually, so why don't you go check with Izzy to see where we are.
 C:   &o  Talk to Izzy.
 Izzy
  &6[Izzy]&r
 We should be close, but we'll need to spot some landmarks to know exactly where we are. Could you please ask Levyn if he can
see anything on the horizon?
  &5[Sure!]&r
  &6[Izzy]&r
 Splendid, thank you.
  &5[Sounds like effort.]&r
  &6[Captain Indigo]&r
 Alright, never mind.
 C:   &o  Talk to Levyn.
 Levyn
  &6[Levyn]&r
 Hello... [Player]... I'm not feeling too good.
  &5[I thought you were supposed to be a pirate? Are you sea sick?]&r
  &6[Levyn]&r
 Just getting my... sea legs... what do you want?
  &5[Have you been able to see anything from up here?]&r
  &6[Levyn]&r
 I can't... see straight at all... can you get a sea sickness cure from... Samwell below deck?
  &5[Sure I'll be right back.]&r
  &6[Levyn]&r
 Thank... you.
 C:   &o  Talk to Samwell.
 Samwell
  &6[Samwell]&r
 Hello [Player], is there anything you need from the stores?
  &5[I need a sea sickness cure, Levyn isn't doing too well.]&r
  &6[Samwell]&r
 Ha! I knew that guy was all talk. Here, we have plenty stocked up. I can't wait to finally get my hands on some treasure.
&o  Samwell's eyes glisten at the thought of treasure.
 Head back to Levyn.
 Levyn
&o  Levyn grabs the cure and drinks it all
  &6[Levyn]&r
 Arrgh, thank you matey! I've never felt more swashbuckling before. Now, about that view: I be seeing land in the distance - an
island! It be about 40 seaports away. ARRGH!
 C:   &o  Talk to Izzy.
 Izzy
  &6[Izzy]&r
 Have you found out what Levyn can see yet?
  &5[He said he could see an island about 40 seaports from here.]&r
  &6[Izzy]&r
 Wonderful, I'll steer us that way now. You should go speak with the Captain.
 C:   &o  Talk to Captain Indigo.
 Captain Indigo
  &6[Captain Indigo]&r
 So you've finally checked in with Izzy. Took you long enough. Looks like we'll arrive shortly.
  &5[Arrgh.]&r
  &6[Izzy]&r
 PIRATE BOAT INCOMING! EVERYONE TO THE DECK!
 C:   &o  The ship is under attack, get outside quickly!
  &6[Captain Xeno]&r
 You have entered the waters of Mistport - my waters - without permission! Prepare to be boarded!
  &6[Izzy]&r
 This is bad - we got much closer to Mistport than I expected.
  &6[Samwell]&r
 Mistport? I've never heard of such a place. What could we have done wrong by simply getting too close to the island?
  &6[Izzy]&r
 If the rumors are true, it's an island ruled over entirely by pirates. We need to find a way to esca-
  &6[Captain Xeno]&r
 FIRE!
&o  The blasts of the ship make your ears ring, and everything goes black.
&o  You wake up and find yourself in what seems to be a prison.
 C:   &o  You've been imprisoned! Find a way out, and find Izzy and Samwell!!!
 After getting into the sewer:
  &6[Samwell]&r
 This trip has sucked so far! We've been captured, imprisoned, and are now wading through a sewer. And we still have no
treasure! Maybe I shouldn't have left Nyr...
 Izzy
  &6[Izzy]&r
 [Player]! Thank goodness you caught up. We felt kind of bad leaving you passed out in your cell, but, you know, pirate code.
  &5[It's alright, I understand.]&r
  &6[Izzy]&r
 Thank you.
  &5[I'm a bit upset you tried to escape without me.]&r
  &6[Izzy]&r
 It's understandable, but we need to put that aside for now.
  &6[Izzy]&r
 Now we just need to find Levyn and then we can figure out how we're going to get off this island.
  &5[Where is Captain Indigo?]&r
  &6[Izzy]&r
 She is being contained on our ship, which has been impounded on the far side of this port. We'll need to unite the crew before
we organize a rescue.
  &5[Where are we?]&r
  &6[Izzy]&r
 We seem to be in a pirate port. The locals don't seem to like us too much.
  &5[Where is Levyn?]&r
  &6[Izzy]&r
 Well that's a tough one. He ran ahead yelling something about parlay and rum. My best guess is he was trying to find a pub.
  &5[I'd better go look for him in a pub then.]&r
  &6[Izzy]&r
 Sounds good. We'll be hiding out here.
 C: &o  Search out Levyn in the Mistport pub.
 Levyn
  Coordinates: [-823, 88, 1367]
   &6[Levyn]&r
 If it isn't my favorite drinking buddy [Player]! So good to see you finally join us matey.
  &5[Levyn, we need to go. We aren't safe here.]&r
  &6[Levyn]&r
 Nonsense! These are our fellow swashbucklers. There was just a slight misunderstanding, that's all.
  &5[But they threw us in prison.]&r
  &6[Levyn]&r
 Haha yes! Classic mistake that was. Trust me, we're all good now. As long as we can join their ranks we're welcome to stay.
  &5[No, we shouldn't join them.]&r
  &6[Levyn]&r
 Arrgh! Ye best reconsider your answer.
  &5[I suppose we can do that.]&r
  &6[Levyn]&r
 Arrgh! Shiver me timbers and a yo ho ho! Welcome to Mistport, home of the Virdian Pirates!
