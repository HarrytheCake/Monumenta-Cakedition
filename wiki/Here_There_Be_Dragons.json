Table\n Izzy\n  &6[Izzy]\n Ahh [Player], what impeccable timing you always have.\n  &5[That sounds like you\u2019re signing me up to do something.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n I absolutely am, and it\u2019s a big one! I've heard about your adventure in the ruins of the Congress. A brand new wool? The Teal\nSpirit involved again? Turns out the Mage Council isn't done yet, and has tasked me to investigate another source of Teal-\nadjacent magic somewhere in the northwest ocean. I wanted to ask you to come along. Maybe we can finish this.\n  &5[Well that does sound worthy of my time.]\n  &5[Oh no, not another sea voyage...]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Worry not, this won\u2019t be some scrappy pirate operation. We\u2019ve been funded by the Council to outfit the ship with high-end\nmagical equipment and actually edible food. It\u2019ll practically be a vacation. I\u2019ll do all the work and all I need you for is in\ncase of emergency!\n  &5[A vacation would be kind of nice. Count me in.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Wonderful. I\u2019d be remiss not to employ Indigo for this expedition, so go let her know the good news and meet me in the Mistport\nPub basement. We\u2019ve got to carry the supplies I purchased over to her ship.\n&o  C: Talk to Captain Indigo. Table\n Captain Indigo\n  &6[Captain Indigo]\n Ahoy [Player], to what do I owe the pleasure today?\n  &5[Izzy has lined up an expedition and wants to employ you and your ship to do some magical research.]\n  &6[Captain Indigo]\n Well that is good news! I could really use the income. Ever since I transported Bhairavi and her team here the work has been\npretty sparse. When do we set sail?\n  &5[Izzy needed my help grabbing supplies out of the Pub basement. We set sail when we return.]\n  &6[Captain Indigo]\n I\u2019ll ready the ship then. See you in a jiffy.\n&o  C: Meet Izzy in the Salty Seaswindler basement. Table\n Izzy\n  &6[Izzy]\n Took you long enough. I was starting to get unwelcome looks from the pirates upstairs. It\u2019s like they can sense I\u2019ve got a\nmountain of money to fund this expedition.\n  &6[Levyn]\n Argh do me ears deceive me? Or did I hear that me crew be planning a voyage without me!\n  &5[Levyn, what are you doing down here?]\n  &6[Levyn]\n I\u2019ve fallen on hard times, ye see. The bartender bet I couldn\u2019t finish off a keg of ale...\n  &6[Levyn]\n ...but I showed \u2018im. As payment fer the bet I acquired free room an\u2019 board down \u2018ere in the bilge of this \u2018ere establishment.\n  &5[Do you need help?]\n  &6[Levyn]\n Me? Need help?? Ye be askin\u2019 that the wrong way around. Levyn\u2019s crew is nothin\u2019 without Levyn! And I know just the way to spend\nthat cash ye have to make this trip run ship shape.\n  &5[I think Izzy already covered supplies.]\n  &6[Levyn]\n Supplies we\u2019ll get to, but first we be missin\u2019 a quartermaster. Ever since Samwell went rotten, me crew has never been the\nsame. But we\u2019ll fix that promptly, eh. Go on and take yer supplies to the ship. Return when yer done and I\u2019ll have a\nquartermaster sorted out. Now make haste.\n&o  C [1/3]: Leave the basement.\n&o  C [2/3]: Go back to Indigo's Ship.\n&o  C [3/3]: Talk to Izzy belowdecks. Table\n Izzy\n  &6[Izzy]\n I thought Levyn was doing okay, but living under the pub must be rough. I suppose he can come along. And if finishing off a\nfull crew is important to him, I\u2019ve saved enough of the Council\u2019s money to pay for a quartermaster. Would probably be worthwhile\nhaving someone care for my equipment.\n  &5[I\u2019ll go retrieve Levyn.]\n  &6[Captain Indigo]\n Don\u2019t dilly dally, we\u2019re ready to set off.\n&o  C: Go retrieve Levyn from the Mistport Pub Basement.\n Assorted Dialogue when talking to the npcs in the pub basement:\n  &6[Clarence]\n My chance is finally here! Pick me!\n  &6[Sarah]\n This is weird...\n  &6[Salty Bartender]\n Ye har har har!\n  &6[Samuel]\n Where is my food? How did I get down here?\n&o  C: Listen to Levyn's magnificent proposal. Table\n Levyn\n  &6[Levyn]\n Yer in for quite the treat matey, for we have options for our new quartermaster!\n  &5[Just pick one and let\u2019s go, Izzy and Indigo are ready to leave.]\n  &6[Levyn]\n Not so fast landlubber, if we don\u2019t have a top-notch quartermaster, our stuff may not be stored properly.\n  &5[How hard can the job be?]\n  &6[Levyn]\n I\u2019ll let that slide as ye must not \u2018ave ever had a subpar quartermaster before. I do miss me favorite peg leg so dearly.\n  &5[Levyn you have two legs.]\n  &5[Alright, let\u2019s just get this over with.]\n  &6[Levyn]\n Argh it be time to meet the candidates [Player]. Let\u2019s get this started.\n  &6[Levyn]\n Are ye ready to meet our first candidate?\n  &5[Doesn\u2019t this seem like a bit much to you?]\n  &6[Levyn]\n Nonsense matey, I told the barkeep that Izzy be footin\u2019 the bill with his magic money.\n  &5[Izzy didn\u2019t agree to that.]\n  &6[Levyn]\n CONTESTANT NUMBER ONE: SAMWELL\n  &5[Wait Samwell is here?!]\n  &6[Not Samwell]\n Actually my name is Clarence. I heard that the job offers dental. I do have a few teeth I need pulled.\n  &5[We aren\u2019t offering benefits.]\n  &6[Not Samwell]\n Oh well I suppose if the pay is good enough, I can manage out of pocket.\n  &5[The pay isn\u2019t that good.]\n  &6[Not Samwell]\n There\u2019s still an equal split of the treasure as advertised, right?\n  &5[What treasure???]\n  &6[Levyn]\n ANYWAY!\n  &6[Levyn]\n NEXT UP, CONTESTANT NUMBER TWO: SAMUEL\n  &5[Is that really his name?]\n  &6[Samuel]\n It is, but I\u2019m actually just looking for my waiter. I\u2019ve been waiting on my food for over an hour.\n  &5[I think Levyn closed down the pub for this.]\n  &6[Samuel]\n That is ridiculous! I\u2019ve been coming to this pub every week for the past several years and never in my time here have I seen\nsuch atrocious service. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019ve bought out the whole town, I will not let this slide. You\u2019ll be hearing from my\nattorney.\n  &5[Well that\u2019s definitely not our quartermaster.]\n  &6[Levyn]\n Yer right, this guy be a dud. So let\u2019s move on to CONTESTANT NUMBER THREE: SARAHWELL\n  &5[You\u2019re joking, right?]\n  &6[Sarah]\n It\u2019s just Sarah, I kept telling you that. Look, you don\u2019t have to pay me much, I\u2019m just trying to get some experience. I\u2019ve\ninterned with Captain Lamis before. Is that good enough?\n  &5[Sarah actually seems kind of promising.]\n  &6[Levyn]\n I don\u2019t know \u2018bout this one. Cheap labor usually be a bad investment.\n  &5[Are there any more contestants?]\n  &6[Levyn]\n Argh yer right, Samuel did quit, I s\u2019pose we do need one more to fill out the line up. Bartender, would you like to audition as\nCONTESTANT NUMBER TWO?\n  &5[I regret asking already...]\n  &5[Well this will be good.]\n  &6[Salty Bartender]\n Zee har har I be more swashbucklin\u2019 than the rest of ye and yer mum brined in pickle juice for a month. If there be money in\nit, I\u2019ll swab ze decks like the best of \u2018em.\n  &5[Ha, Levyn he might have you beat in piratey-ness.]\n  &5[This may not have been the best choice.]\n  &6[Levyn]\n Who does this guy think he is? The pirate stuff is a bit over the top.\n  &5[Can we just pick a quartermaster?]\n  &6[Levyn]\n I\u2019ll let ye do the honors, who will it be?\n  &5[Clarence.]\n  &5[Sarah.]\n  &5[The bartender.]\n  &6[Levyn]\n On second thought, who knows a true pirate better than me. We\u2019re goin with good old Samwell.\n  &5[I thought you were letting me choose?]\n  &6[Levyn]\n Though our budget be large, thar be no room for another one of those pesky \u201cBranching Adventures\u201d.\n  &5[Alright Clarence it is, it doesn\u2019t really matter.]\n  &6[Levyn]\n I knew ye would come around! Let's head back ta Indigo's ship!\n  &6[Not Samwell]\n Thank you very much for the opportunity, I won\u2019t let you down.\n&o  C:: Head back to the Ship.\n  &6[Captain Indigo]\n Back at last, I see. Izzy'll be doing the introductions, I imagine. Go chat with them belowdecks.\n&o  C: Talk to Izzy. Table\n Izzy\n  &6[Levyn]\n Ahhh, the sweet sea air!\n  &6[Izzy]\n Welcome to the ship after all that time! You must be... Samwell?\n  &6[Not Samwell]\n It\u2019s Clarence actu-\n  &6[Levyn]\n His name be Samwell!\n  &5[Anyway, do we have all the supplies?]\n  &6[Levyn]\n I can hardly call these \u2018ere supplies, but sure.\n  &5[Then let's sail!]\n  &5[Give me a moment, I need to prepare. It could be dangerous!]\n  Color|Orange|[Izzy]\n I imagine it will be, yeah. Hurry up mate!\n  &6[Izzy]\n Aye aye!\n&o  C: Chat with your Crew. Table\n Izzy\n  &6[Izzy]\n We\u2019re arriving at the location and there appears to be an island ahead. How\u2019s the crew doing?\n  &5[I hear Levyn\u2019s seasick again, and \u201cNot Samwell\u201d gave him rum instead of medicine.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n They\u2019re off to a great start I see. Are you prepared to go inland ahead of us?\n  &5[Not yet, I need to get back to Mistport to resupply.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Meet us back here then - you'll have to find your own way. You can head up the ladder to get overboard.\n  &5[I am. What do we need to do?]\n  &6[Izzy]\n We need to investigate this island. I suppose you can go ahead, while Clarence and I set up the ship.\n  &5[Anything in particular I should be looking for?]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Anything unusual I suppose. All I know is that we found traces of the Teal spirit\u2019s magic coming from this area of the ocean.\nThere\u2019s got to be something weird going on. Resistance, weird doors, floating explosive spirits. Ya know. Stuff. Head up the\nladder and get going!\n  &6[Levyn]\n Let us know once ye've found *hic* anything treasure-ish... I'll get meself up and claim some booty for meself, no matter how\nseasick!\n  &6[Clarence]\n Look, Levyn said he was feeling \"briney\" and I gave him what I had! How was I supposed to know the bottles were rum?!\n&o  C: [1/2]: Leave the Ship.\n&o  C: [2/2]: Venture into the   Link   City Of Bones City_Of_Bones wikilink  .\n  In the   Link   City Of Bones City_Of_Bones wikilink there are 3 chests that contain etched bones, located at [-2063, 93,\n-436] (Nitigskild), [-2046, 130, -456] (Inskywing), [-2048, 148, -457] (Aanbiddij). Upon gathering these, head to the bottom\nsection of the POI and step on the pressure plate to be teleported to the next part of the quest. Proceed to the Sealed Remorse\nlobby past [-2042, 90, -468] and speak to Izzy on the left side to complete the quest.\n LineBreak &o  C: Chat with Izzy in this strange tunnel. Table\n Izzy\n  &6[Levyn]\n *Hic* Ye best be careful. Lookin\u2019 dangerous here mate. Me head hurts too much ta help...\n  &5[Something\u2019s definitely off here.]\n  &6[Not Samwell]\n I\u2019ll scout ahead.\n  &5[Can you look for traps?]\n  &6[Levyn]\n No! Not Samwell! Let [Player] investigate first. They be excellent at adventurin\u2019.\n  &6[Not Samwell]\n AHHHHHHHHH\n&o  C: Find a way through the ruins.\n&o  C [1/2]: Find your way back into the depths of the City of Bones.\n&o  C [2/2]: Find and talk to Izzy. Table\n Bonafide Gatekeeper\n  &6[Bonafide Gatekeeper]\n H-hey, you! How did you get past all the guards and traps outside?!\n  &5[Apparently the guards and the traps aren't very good at their jobs.]\n  &6[Bonafide Gatekeeper]\n So w-what, are you here to kill us all? Take our treasure? I assure you we have none! It's just bones... all we have are\nbones...\n  &5[Look, just give me a key, I've got things to investigate inside.]\n  &6[Bonafide Gatekeeper]\n I-I can't. It's l-lost and locked aw-way... PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!\n  &5[Look, just give me a key. I don't care about the quest, I just wanna fight.]\n  &5[Yes.]\n  &6[Bonafide Gatekeeper]\n ...Are y-you sure?\n  &5[No.]\n  &6[Bonafide Gatekeeper]\n (literal blank)  Table\n Izzy\n  &6[Izzy]\n This is fascinating...\n  &5[What is it?]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Some sort of ancient tablet with writing on it. The first language I don\u2019t know at all, but the second seems to be the writing\nBhairavi gave you to locate the Echo of Isharist. I think I can decipher this!\n  &5[Wait, you\u2019re not going to make me do it?]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Of course not, this is super interesting to me, [Player]. You\u2019re just here to defend us after all.\n  &5[Oh.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Anyway, it seems to be talking about a group called the Blackflame. They used to live here, and died? After they died, another\ngroup moved in and began to worship their bones... Oh!\n  &5[What?]\n  &6[Izzy]\n I think those bones the city is made from were the Blackflame. They weren\u2019t humans. They were Dragons.\n  &5[Dragons?!]\n  &6[Izzy]\n I don\u2019t even think there\u2019s any left alive. Fascinating. This tablet, which I think I\u2019ll call the Rosetta Bone, seems to imply\nthere\u2019s more writings out in the city above us. Do you think you could find them? According to this, there\u2019s three more that may\nhelp us understand how to move deeper into this area.\n  &5[Will do.]\n  [Izzy]\n Good luck!\n  &5[Why the Rosetta Bone?]\n  &6[Izzy]\n I once courted a lovely archaeologist named Rosetta. We still stay in contact. I bet she\u2019d love this - and might like me more\nif I named it after her.\n&o  C [1/2]: Leave the Rosetta Bone and head back into the City of Bones to find three Bone Carvings.\n&o  C [2/2]: Show Izzy the Bone Carvings. Table\n Izzy\n If no carvings in inventory:\n  &6[Izzy]\n Have you found any carvings yet?\n  &5[Not yet.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Get to it then!\n If carvings (You can bring them one at a time):\n  &6[Izzy]\n Have you found any carvings yet?\n  &5[I found this carving. It's got a picture of a doorway on it.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Let me see if I can decipher this! Nice find!\n  &5[Let me know how it goes.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Oh, this isn\u2019t too hard. It\u2019s talking about that gateway further in. It\u2019s been sealed by the Blackflame worshippers and seems\nto be a ritual site of great importance. Something the Blackflame did is behind there, and only the most trusted can enter.\n  &5[Anything else?]\n  &6[Izzy]\n I don\u2019t see anything about how to get inside on here, but it does mention a small spell at the end. I have the words, but not\nwhat magics need to be channeled or items are necessary. I doubt they knew of the Tree of Life theories either.\n  &5[That would be a surprise.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Maybe some other carvings will be more useful.\n  &5[I'll see what I can find.]\n  &5[I found this carving. It's got a symbol of a shield on it.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Aha, I think I can decipher this!\n  &5[You can handle it?]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Of course [Player], I\u2019m not useless here. Alright, let\u2019s see\u2026\n  &5[I\u2019ll wait here.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n No need to wait. This carving speaks of another group the Blackflame Dragons had some contact with. They had some sort of pact,\nwhere they would be protected by the Blackflame in exchange for... um, I think this is saying some sort of magical shield\nagainst something called \u201cvoid\u201d?\n  &5[Interesting. I think the Conscriptorium in the Congress had something to do with void as well.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n I\u2019ll have to reach out to Bhairavi then. I\u2019d really like to know more.\n  &5[I\u2019m sure we can see for ourselves inside. Anything on that?]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Nothing yet. I think there\u2019s a component to a spell here though. I think this is just asking for a lot of crystalline shards,\nactually.\n  &5[I can get some of that!]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Maybe some other carvings will be more useful.\n  &5[I'll see what I can find.]\n  &5[I found this carving. It has a picture of a bone on it. Recursive.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n I believe I can read this, if you allow me a few moments!\n  &5[Take your time.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Always. Now let\u2019s see. This carving speaks of the formation of the worshippers. Following the fall of the Blackflame to an\nunknown cause, it seems these people were drawn to this island and to the bones of the decaying Dragons. It claims the very\nbones here hold power, and these followers serve only to preserve that power... \u201clest the void dissolve and those within break\ntheir vigil\u201d. I have no idea what any of that means, honestly.\n  &5[Nor I.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n On the plus side, I see what seems to be a component here for a spell. Gold bars!\n  &5[I\u2019ll go gather some of those.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n It looks like that\u2019s all three carvings mentioned on the Rosetta Bone. We\u2019ll need a lot of crystalline shards, some gold bars,\nand some magic channeled into them. Bring them to me and give them to me, and I\u2019ll make it happen. Just trade me when you\u2019re\nready!\n&o  C: Gather five Bone Shards and one Gold Ingot and bring them back to Izzy. Table\n Izzy\n  &6[Izzy]\n Woah! You okay over there [Player]? I think it's time we go discover what's going on inside.\n  Color|teal|'''HERE THERE BE DRAGONS COMPLETE!'''<br>Awarded access to the [[Sealed Remorse]] ike... and perhaps more within?\n", "reward": "rewards =\n* Access to the &3Sealed Remorse&r strike\n* ...and perhaps more within?\n"}
