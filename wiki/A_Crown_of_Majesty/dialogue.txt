 Thanks again for all your help! I think Sybil has something else for you now. But if you want, I have another job I need help
with. A big, exciting one this time!
  Color|purple|[I'm in. What do you need?]
  Color|orange|[Aimee]
 Alright, so. I don't know if you've ever seen the King's crown, but it looks ridiculous! his birthday is coming up so I've been
commissioned to make a new one. I need three gems to do it, from more dangerous mines outside the city this time, think you can
handle it?
  Color|PURPLE|[I'm in, where should I look?]
  Color|orange|[Aimee]
 Yay, thank you so much! I need a garnet, malachite, and an onyx from three other mines. They're on the east and south parts of
the swamp, and they're not the best but I do have some maps that should help if you want.
  Color|PURPLE|[Nah, I like the silly crown]
  &6[Aimee]
 Really? He can't even see out of it!
  Color|purple|[No, I'm sick of the mines.]
  &6[Aimee]
 Aww, I was hoping I could count on you. I didn't want to ask anyone else because it's supposed to be a secret project.  Header

 Wow, that was fast! I'll have plenty of time to finish this crown! Here, I have a tiara for you that makes you more healthy
like the last one! I'll get working on the crown right away!
  [Be careful, I think that Onyx might be cursed]
  &6[Aimee]
 Cursed? Don't be silly, there's no such thing as curses. They're a legend, like dragons and Septum.
&o  A CROWN OF MAJESTY COMPLETE! Awarded Jeweled Tiara and 128 Enchanting Bottles.
