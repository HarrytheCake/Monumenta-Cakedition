 Hey, I've been looking for you! Got two priority letters, urgent delivery and all that. Here you are, just sign here.
  &5[Sign for the Letters.]
  &6[Postman]
 Here you are. Oh, and let me know if you need another copy, every priority letter is magically registered and can be copied as-
needed.
  &5[I'll get them later.]
  &6[Postman]
 Sounds great! After running all around the Valley looking for you I could use a break. I'll still be here when you want to pick
those letters up.

 Welcome to the Order of Glass. While Murano and his men guard the realm from armies and murderers, we defend it against the
insidious threats. Corruption, spies, cults, and all manner of sinister crimes. And you've already run into one of the most
corrupt me plaguing Sierhaven.
  &5[Who?]
  &5[Octavius.]
  &5[Levyn.]
  &6[Argent]
 No. Octavius is the threat. He and his Five Axes company smuggle weapons and protect all manner of filth from prosecution. Do
me a favor, walk to the edge of the tower and look at his booth.
  &6[Argent]
 Looks so innocuous doesn't it? But he has money and political protection far beyond his means, and we're not sure who he's
working for. But now we have an opportunity.
  &5[What opportunity?]
  &6[Argent]
 Carlton, the former accountant of the Five Axes Trading Company has left. Fearing for his life, he requested protection from
the guard in exchange for information. Unfortunately, he was force to flee Farr before we could rendezvous with him. Find
Carlton, ensure his safety, and learn what he knows.
  &5[I'm on it.]
  &5[Not interested.]
  &6[Argent]
 You seem to think you had a choice. We need you, and The Order of Glass gets what we need. Carlton lived in Farr, start there.
&o  Look around Farr for clues to where Carlton fled to. Find him and talk to him. Table

 I got such a great deal on this house! Carlton, the guy who lived here wanted to sell quick; he practically ran towards the
highlands! Said he was goin to an old abandoned house there.
 Head to the   Link   Infested House Infested_House wikilink poi.
  In the basement of the poi there is a lever on the south wall. When you pull
 it a entrance will appear nearby.

 Don't hurt me!

 Thank goodness, I was worried you were one of the Five Axes goons. Wait, you weren't followed right?
  &5[Of course not!]

 Alright boys, search the place! Tear it apart until you found that bean counter!

 T-thanks, I thought I was doomed there.
  &5[No Problem. Now, Octavius?]
  &6[Carlton]
 O-of course. All of his financial records are kept in a warehouse in Farr, that should tell you everything you need. There's a
basement with a vault in it, but you have to solve a maze to get there. I don't know all the tricks, but I remember hearing to
'follow the shadows'. I hope that helps you bring him in.
&o  Find your way through the maze beneath the Five Axes Trading Co warehouse. You should start by following the shadows.
  When you get into the basement, to go through the maze follow the path without torches.

 Pleasure to meet you. Now hand over the ledger before we have to do something you'll regret.

 Invisibility clocks. They're quite wonderful really, perhaps one day you'll be able to afford one. Now, hand over the ledger.
  &5[Here, take the ledgers.]
  &6[Duchess Emmeline]
 Well thank you, I was worried there was going to be bloodshed but this was much simpler. If you're ever in the Celsian Isles,
stop by. I think you, me, and Octavius need to have a little chat. Salieri, take us home.
  &5[No, I'm turning these in.]
&o  The ledger is gone. Tell Argent what happened. Table

 I heard a commotion. Is everything alright? Do you have the ledgers?
  &5[Duchess Emmeline showed up.]
  &6[Argent]
 I see. I assume that swordsage of hers, Salieri, was there too. Well, at least now we know who's been backing Octavius.
  &5[The ledgers were taken.]
  &6[Argent]
 It may not be the outcome we wanted, but you nonetheless aided the Order of Glass. For this, I thank you and reward you. Expect
us to call upon your services again when the Kingdom needs defending.
