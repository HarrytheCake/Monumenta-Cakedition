Table\n Marshall Ludvic\n  Coordinates: [-1434 107 2917]\n   &6[Marshall Ludvic]\n Let\u2019s see here... Oh, hello. You\u2019re the... Captain, yes? Good to meet you properly. I\u2019m here on behalf of her Majesty, Queen\nObregson, to represent her in this conference.\n  &5[Do you have any information on the whereabouts of the Teal Spirit?]\n  &6[Marshall Ludvic]\n Oh, yes, that I do. There was an event several months back on the west end of the continent which was, at the time, blamed on\nthe mages hiding out in Wispervale. A large storm had formed above an ancient tower, lightning crashing down around the area.\nAllegedly, this was an attempt at some dangerous ritual by the mages, designed to destroy the crown for good...\n  &6[Marshall Ludvic]\n Yet, as our nation begins to grow more tolerant of magic, some scrutiny has been placed on these claims. As far as we can tell,\nthe mages of Wispervale were not responsible for this event.\n  &6[Marshall Ludvic]\n With the knowledge of this rogue spirit, it seems possible that it was the source of the magic on that day. I couldn\u2019t tell you\nwhat it was attempting - the tower returned to normal long before anyone could investigate. But, perhaps that is enough of a\nlead to help you with your search.\n Talking again:\n  &6[Marshall Ludvic]\n Hmm... Let's see... Oh, hello again, Captain. What else can I do for you? Is the meeting getting underway?\n  &5[Not yet, just checking back in.]\n  &6[Marshall Ludvic]\n Thanks for checking. I've got nothing new, I'm afraid.  Table\n Wilhelm\n  Coordinates: [-1435 107 2915]\n   &6[Wilhelm]\n [Player], good to see you. I had hoped our troubles would have mostly ended when we removed Ridnan, but it seems there is more\nwork to do.\n  &5[There's always more work to do. Do you have any information on the whereabouts of the Teal Spirit?]\n  &6[Wilhelm]\n Ah! I personally do not, no. I did, however, invite my old friend Artol to this council. He believes he has seen something that\nfits your search.\n  &5[It\u2019s good to see you as well. How are things in Chillwind?]\n  &6[Wilhelm]\n Things are going as well as they can be, I would say. A sizable group of Magehunters fled the capitol after Ridnan\u2019s removal\nfrom power, and seem to still be at large... But we have it handled.  Table\n Artol\n  Coordinates: [-1435 107 2915]\n   &6[Artol]\n Hm. Well met, Paladin [Player]. I trust your adventures have gone well? You\u2019ve slain many undead in your travels, surely!\n  &5[I\u2019ve defeated many undead, Artol.]\n  &6[Artol]\n Excellent! Fine work, my friend. You have made an excellent paladin in your time away.\n  &5[Wilhelm told me you have information about Teal.]\n  &6[Artol]\n Ah. Yes. The strange spirit. Not my area of expertise, I will admit. The undead are my only foes.\n  &6[Artol]\n I have, in any case, seen a strange sight indeed. During one of my routine patrols around Nightroost, my eye was caught by\nflashes of otherworldly light deep within the abandoned dig sight.\n  &6[Artol]\n As I descended to investigate, I caught a glimpse of an impossibility. An arm of a mighty Frost Giant burst from the ground,\nflailing and grasping at seemingly nothing. A tall figure floated above, watching. In a blink of an eye, it vanished along with\nthe arm.\n  &6[Artol]\n The area was scarred with a strange magic, unlike any I have seen before. I have seen nothing since, though I have kept my eye\non the area.\n Talking again:\n  &6[Artol]\n Hm. You return. What can I do for you?\n  &5[Just seeking information still.]\n  &6[Artol]\n Pursuit of knowledge is often the best way forward.  Table\n Brandy\n  Coordinates: [-1423 107 2920]\n   &6[Brandy]\n Hello again [Player]. Nice to see you without a prisoner needing persuading this time.\n  &5[Good to see you Brandy. How's the family?]\n  &6[Brandy]\n Doing well! Cinevra wanted to come along, but I told her to stay put for now. She says hello.  Table\n Archivist Nyra\n  Coordinates: [-1420 107 2917]\n   &6[Archivist Nyra]\n So you\u2019re Mistport\u2019s Captain, then? I suppose I should have connected the dots, what with the strange questions you kept asking\nme about our history.\n  &5[That's me. What information do you have on the whereabouts of the Teal Spirit?]\n  &6[Archivist Nyra]\n Oh, yes, the rogue spirit. I will admit, this was a challenging topic to research, even with all our resources... But I believe\nI managed to find an item which is relevant to your search.\n  &6[Archivist Nyra]\n Out in the Ishniran desert was a statue that seemed to depict a Silver Knight, based on the research I did. Here's the catch\nthough. It was quite grand only a few years back. However, your friend Bhairavi has told me it's destroyed and she found\nimportant writings inside.\n  &6[Archivist Nyra]\n I've since found an eyewitness to its destruction! His name was Ron or something. He saw a glowing figure appear near it, float\naround for a bit, then the whole thing began to crumble quite suddenly. Then it was gone. I hope that helps!\n Talking again:\n  &6[Archivist Nyra]\n Ah, the Captain returns. What can I do for you?\n  &5[I'm still looking for more information.]\n  &6[Archivist Nyra]\n Alas, I have none for you. Perhaps someone else will.  Table\n Torren\n  Coordinates: [-1419 107 2915]\n   &6[Torren]\n Well met [Player]. I'm surprised you managed to coordinate another meeting here so quickly.\n  &5[Me too. Do you have any information about the Teal Spirit? I've been asking around to gather what we know.]\n  &6[Torren]\n I think I do. Alnera had to send a regimen to the north of Ishnir recently to handle reports of what I could only describe as\nwell... one of our founding god myths, Mauta, appearing.\n  &5[That sounds amazing.]\n  &6[Torren]\n You would think, but all we found were smoldering remains of humans, coated in magma-like armor that cooled into something more\nsilver. Like a war had been fought under the lava itself. People nearby claimed to have seen a glowing figure floating about the\nlava, then the molten flow itself came alive and began to form into a figure. The being seemed to take something, then it\nvanished.\n  &6[Torren]\n From your description, the figure sounds like Teal, but I have no idea what it could have been seeking. I hope this is enough\nto help you.\n Talking again:\n  &6[Torren]\n Well met again [Player]. What brings you back?\n  &5[Still poking around for information. I figured talking to everyone a bunch could help.]\n  &6[Torren]\n I wish I could help more.  Table\n Head Guard Obadiah\n  Coordinates: [-1420 107 2913]\n   &6[Head Guard Obadiah]\n Well hello Captain [Player].\n  &5[Hi Obadiah. Sorry again for accusing you...]\n  &6[Head Guard Obadiah]\n Not to worry. I think I've gotten over it! What can I do for you?\n  &5[I'm looking for information on the Teal Wool spirit.]\n  &6[Head Guard Obadiah]\n I'm not sure I can help you, but I know Nyra has a story for you.  Table\n Izzy\n  Coordinates: [-1431 107 2909]\n   &6[Izzy]\n Ahoy [Player]! So, we're finally doing this?\n  &5[Yes indeed. It's time to find Teal and take it down.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n We\u2019ll figure out what to do about Teal, I\u2019m sure of it. I think you should go chat with everyone you can. Maybe they have some\ngood information we can use.  Table\n Pten\n  Coordinates: [-1429 107 2908]\n   &6[Pten]\n Hail [Player]. It's good to see you again, even under dire circumstances.\n  &5[Indeed. How goes the project at the Congress?]\n  &6[Pten]\n Well, but slow. We've been trying to recover parts of the Conscriptorium recently. Fascinating stuff, but seriously, so\ndangerous. Would have been far worse without your help in there.  Table\n Vargos\n  Coordinates: [-1425 107 2908]\n   &6[Vargos]\n Welcome to the meeting, [Player]. Head around and chat with the guests. See what information you can get together before we\nstart the meeting properly.\n  Meeting: Table\n Bhairavi\n  Coordinates: [-1427 107 2907]\n   &6[Bhairavi]\n So! Have you spoken to everyone yet?\n  &5[Not yet. I still have a few people I need to get to.]\n  &6[Bhairavi]\n Okay. Let me know when you're ready to discuss.\n  &5[I\u2019ve spoken to everyone I need to, yes.]\n  &6[Bhairavi]\n Excellent. Do we have any new leads from the information you got?\n  &5[Not really. Some of the reports could actually be Teal, but if it was, the spirit\u2019s long gone by now.]\n  &6[Bhairavi]\n That\u2019s\u2026 discouraging. Is there at least something that the reports share in common? Something that could link them together?\n  &5[Well, Teal seems to really dislike the Silver Knights. Some reports include it messing with or destroying things that could\nbe linked to the knights.]\n  &6[Bhairavi]\n The Silver Knights... What do we know about them?\n  &6[Izzy]\n The Silver Knights are enforcers, seeking out Wool. Traces of them are hard to find, but they've been active all over the\nworld, in ancient history, and have left traces of their time around. Legends as well. Great battles.\n  &6[Pten]\n They certainly were involved with the creation of the Monuments. [Player] got a Hammer of theirs from the Valley that Farr's\npeople found at said Monument.\n  &5[I've met some Knights.]\n  &6[Bhairavi]\n I'm sorry, what?\n  &5[I found one in the Valley underneath the Monument. I found another here in the Isles during an adventure related to\nSalazar, under the Silver Tower.]\n  &6[Vargos]\n Why are you just now bringing this up [Player]? Were any of them alive?\n  &5[Not those ones, but I did meet three who spoke with me briefly under the City of Bones, in the Blackflame city. ]\n  &6[Izzy]\n I thought I mentioned those guys to you Archmage Vargos?\n  &5[Maybe you did. Maybe time reverted again? Things were weird there... They can't help us though. They can't leave. It's\ncomplicated.]\n  &6[Vargos]\n So basically we can't actually speak to the Knights to see if they know anything. Shame.\n  &6[Torren]\n Nor do we have any actual knowledge of where this Teal spirit is.\n  &6[Wilhelm]\n Nor do we even have the capability to catch it.\n  &6[Marshall Ludvic]\n Will our forces even work against it? The Wools are dangerous after all. Something living with that power could decimate us\nwith a thought! How would we win?\n  &6[Obadiah]\n So this was all pointless then?\n  &6[Brandy]\n Surely there's a reason we're all here... Why would we have just randomly been called together to-\n  &6[Bhairavi]\n Hey. Hey! HEY! Shut up! There's a reason we're all here, and it's to try and pool our resources and our knowledge to try and\ncome up with something. So, does anyone have any ideas?\n  &5[I... I know someone who would know how to help. He's called the Crimson King. He's... another Wool Spirit, from the Crimson\nWool.]\n  &6[Vargos]\n ...EXCUSE ME?! WHY ARE YOU JUST NOW BRINGING THIS UP?\n  &6[Bhairavi]\n Surely you're joking. There isn't a Crimson Wool.\n  &5[Not anymore. It was destroyed during the attack on the city of Farr by C'Telsket, a leader of the Sons of the Forest.]\n  &6[Vargos]\n ...Um. What? We didn't know of Wool back then. Herring died in that attack... Maxwel- Calder... He and Minerva, his friend,\nsurvived that attack. They never mentioned a Wool.\n  &5[He holds domain over Memory. His release caused a severe warp in memory nearby, even keeping Farr trapped in its damaged\nstate.]\n  &6[Bhairavi]\n Why is this all making sense...? You really know another Wool Spirit?\n  &5[I do, and I count him as an ally. Unlike Teal, he is not hostile, and wants to be back in his Wool.]\n  &6[Bhairavi]\n And you believe him? The Wools... They lie, [Player]. You know this. We've all heard the stories and seen the destruction\nthey've wrought. You and I have been involved in far too many adventures involving the dangers they pose. Would the Crimson\nspirit actually work against Teal?\n  &5[Yes. To all of it.]\n  &6[Bhairavi]\n Do you know that for sure?\n  &6[Izzy]\n Yeah... Can he actually be trusted, or is he just working with you to get what he wants?\n  &6[Brandy]\n I've not said much so far but... the Wool. They've caused such horrors. Would it be so bad if one were helping heal? [Player]\nhas more experience with this being than us. This could be a chance for us.\n  The gathered crowd murmurs agreement... slightly.\n  &6[Vargos]\n I think Brandy is right. I think we should be taking the allies we can get. If [Player] truly has gained an ally of a Wool\nspirit, and they can offer us help in resolving this crisis, we should take it.\n  &5[Thank you for your thoughts. Should I pay him a visit?]\n  Voices break out across the room. Excited. Nervous. Scared. Hopeful. Eventually the murmuring reaches an agreement... until...\n  &6[Vargos]\n Yes.\n  &5[I hope he can help us.]\n  &6[Vargos]\n For all of our sakes, yes. Go pay your Crimson King in the King's Valley a visit. Let's see what he can do for us.\n Talking to Vargos after the meeting:\n  &6[Vargos]\n Hi [Player]. Go meet with your Wool Spirit, wherever he is. No time to waste.\n&o  C: Travel to the King's Valley and meet with the Crimson King.

After much discussion with my allies, I felt you were the best option to ask for help. Also,\nneither were you?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  I would be glad to assist you. Teal's pedestal would be a good starting point. We could potentially track him from it. Do you\nknow where it is?\n  &5[Pedestal? There wasn't one for Teal with the other Wool in the Celsian Isles.]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  That can not be right. His place was in the Isles. Unless he took his pedestal as well? That would be very odd indeed. The two\nof us, following the same path once again... Can we visit this Monument then?\n  &5[Of course. It's in a place called Steelmeld in the Isles. Will you just follow me?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  That will work. Let me reach out to Jeremiah to get him out of our Monument first. I would rather not leave him trapped in\nthere unexpectedly.
