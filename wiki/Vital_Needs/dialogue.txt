 Hmm... Now where did I put that...?
  Color|purple|[Hello?]
  Color|gray|He's deep in thought while trying to find something in his office.
  Color|orange|[Dr. Qure]
 Oh! I'm terribly sorry, I didn't notice you come in. What can I do for you?
  Color|purple|[I was wondering more what I could do for you.]
  Color|purple|[How about some medical jokes?]
  Color|orange|[Dr. Qure]
 Oh, really now? Well I suppose there is this one thing...
  Color|orange|[Dr. Qure]
 You see, I've lost the ingredients to make a special vitality remedy commonly used in these parts, quite a marvelous elixir! If
you could fetch me some of those I could apply it to you for your travels too!
  Color|purple|[I'll pass for now. They might still be in your office anyway!]
  Color|orange|[Dr. Qure]
 You know what? You could be right!
  Color|gray|He goes back to searching through his desk...
  Color|purple|[I'm in. Where should I start?]
  Color|orange|[Dr. Qure]
 Well, first of all, I require a Tenebre Mushroom from some fungal caves in the nearby islands.
&o  1/2 - Travel to   Link   Fungus Thorn Cave Fungus_Thorn_Cave wikilink in order to obtain a Tenebre Mushroom
&o  2/2 - Once you have a Tenebre Mushroom return to Dr. Qure Table

  Color|orange|[Dr. Qure]
 Ah perfect! You found one! 
  Color|gray|The Doctor chucks some of the mushroom into a mortar and begins to grind it into a fine paste.
  Color|purple|[Alright then, what's next?]
  Color|orange|[Dr. Qure]
 Hmm, a fresh Saragundi Sapling from a nearby forest. I'd say the Feyrune Forest would have an ample supply.
&o  1/2 - Travel to   Link   Feyrune Forest Feyrune_Forest wikilink and retrieve a Saragundi Sapling
&o  2/2 - Once you have a Saragundi Sapling, return to Dr. Qure Table
 Dr. Qure
  Color|orange|[Dr. Qure]
 Fantastic, it looks to be in perfect health!
  Color|gray|The Doctor throws some leaves of the sapling into the mortar.
  Color|purple|[What's the final ingredient?]
  Color|orange|[Dr. Qure]
 So, finally, I require a bottle of Kelp Oil. Unfortunately, some pirates had stolen the last bottle I had from me... I believe
they've gone back to their base camp in the Spiral Island.
  Color|purple|[Lovely...]
  Color|orange|[Dr. Qure]
 Yes, well I suppose it shouldn't be too much harder than fetching the other supplies.
&o  1/2 - Travel to   Link   Spiral Island Spiral_Island wikilink to retrieve some Kelp Oil
&o  2/2 - Once you have some Kelp Oil, return to Dr. Qure Table
 Dr. Qure
  Color|orange|[Dr. Qure]
 Great work! That's the final ingredient!
  Color|gray|He pours a drop of the oil into the mortar, and then puts the mixture into a vial.
  Color|purple|[So, does the medicine work?]
  Color|orange|[Dr. Qure]
 Of course it does! Applying it should give the person great vitality for a good while! With this fresh supply, I should have
enough for weeks! Take this for your troubles.
