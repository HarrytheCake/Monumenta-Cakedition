 Are you about to leave town? Let me give you some advice. If you are looking for an old mine, just follow the signs. I wouldn't
suggest going too far without proper gear, it may be really dangerous...
  &5[Thanks. Who are you?]&r
  &6[Scout Laura]&r
 I'm a scout! Name's Laura. The north side of Sierhaven is particularly vulnerable because the Bandit's onghold is nearby. There
are other threats to the city as well such as the creatures from the old Mage Tower. My assignment is to alert the guards if
problems arise. I uh... got stuck here after I abandoned my old post.
  &5[Old post?]&r
  &6[Scout Laura]&r
 Yeah... I ran from my previous post when I got spotted by Bandits and got stuck here as punishment. I didn't even bring back my
scout's log... Speaking of which... Perhaps you could retrieve it for me? The information I managed to record is too valuable to
be left out in the open, but I can't leave the watch... again.
  &5[I could do that.]&r
  &6[Scout Laura]&r
 Fantastic! I was stationed on a small island south of the Bandit onghold, which can be found to the north. I bet my scout's log
is still there.
  &5[Sorry, I've got a lot going on right now.]&r
  &6[Scout Laura]&r
 That's alright.
&7&o  [1/2]: Head to the isle near the   Link   Bandit onghold Bandit_onghold wikilink and find Laura's Log.
&7&o  [2/2]: Once you've found the log, return it to Laura.
 &7&o  Go to [-950, 103, -355] and retrieve   Link   Scout's Log: Laura Scout's_Log:_Laura wikilink and return to Scout Laura.

  &6[Scout Laura]&r
 Hey, it's you again! Glad to see you alive!
  &5[Thanks. I think I found your book! Take a look.]&r
  &8You give the book to Laura. She quickly turns pages, somewhere to the middle. Then she smiles.&r
  &6[Scout Laura]&r
 Aha! That you did, great! Say, have you, perhaps, read my log? What do you think?
  &5[I have. Seems like the bandits keep something underneath their stronghold.]&r
  &6[Scout Laura]&r
 Not just something. Those bandits have a warehouse there, I'm tell you! Say, perhaps...
  &5[I haven't. What gives?]&r
  &6[Scout Laura]&r
 See, I'm confident that those bandits have a warehouse there. And...
  &8She sighs deeply, as if the next words will hurt her pride. After a moment, she continues...&r
  &6[Scout Laura]&r
 Alright. Fine.     &8Another sigh&r  . Fine. I... I really hate to ask you this, but could you help me take down the bandit's
warehouse? I've been doing some research during my downtime here and I have a theory on how it's laid out.
  &5[Sorry, Laura, but I'm busy. Maybe next time.]&r
  &6[Scout Laura]&r
 Eh, worth a try anyway. At least you brought me my log back.
  &5[I'm all ears. What's the plan?]&r
  &6[Scout Laura]&r
 A friend of mine stationed over at Highwatch sent me a... gift. Don't ask why. Anyway, thanks to Kathryn, I just happen to have
some good explosives. Which I'm going to give to you.
  &5[What exactly do you want me to do with them?]&r
  &6[Scout Laura]&r
 That's the fun part. See, their warehouse is located underground, but you can't just hollow out an empty space underground and
expect it to hold. Not at all. They've got to have a way to keep that ceiling up - support beams, pillars, something. So go find
them and blow them up. Then run for your life! Still game?
  &5[This sounds... extremely dangerous. I need to think.]&r
  &6[Scout Laura]&r
 Alright, take your time. Let me know if you change your mind.
  &5[I'm in!]&r
  &6[Scout Laura]&r
 That's the spirit! here you go; these should be enough. And remember - you need to blow up the main support beams. They are
usually made out of wood and look very thick. If you lose them, I have a few extra and can resupply you. Please don't, though.
You can find the entrance north of the   Link   Bandit's onghold Bandit_onghold wikilink  , by the water.
&7&o  [1/2]: Find a way into the warehouse beneath the   Link   Bandit's onghold Bandit_onghold wikilink  .
&7&o  [2/2]: Once inside the warehouse, set three High-Density TNT charges at three different support beams.
  Warehouse location: SoftBreak  [-904, 91, -464]
  When you try to enter warehouse: SoftBreak   &8Before you lies the entrance to the bandit's warehouse.&r LineBreak   &5[Enter
the warehouse.]&r LineBreak   &5[Leave.]&r
  &8You enter the cave. As you crawl through the dark tunnel, you can hear voices in the distance. At last, you find your way to
the warehouse.&r
 NOTE: You need to click while holding the tnt.
 When you punch the 3x3 stripped log pillar while standing next to it:
  &8You stand before one of three main pillars of the warehouse. What will you do?&r
  &5[Set the charge.]&r
  &8The charge has been set.&r
  &8Bandits sent reinforcements! You have to battle your way through!&r
  Elite Axe, Elite Sniper, Archer, and Bandit spawn.
   &5[Leave.]&r
  &8You decide to leave for now.&r
  Beam spots: SoftBreak  [-902, 98, -539] SoftBreak  [-884, 102, -539] SoftBreak  [-905, 103, -560]
  After placing all three: LineBreak   &8All charges have been set! Hurry to the exit before they detonate!&r
&7&o  C: Escape the warehouse!
 When you go to leave the warehouse:
  &8The dark tunnel looms over you. Do you wish to leave?&r
  &5[Leave.]&r
  &5[Stay.]&r
 If you leave after placing the 3 charges: SoftBreak   &8You hear loud explosions deep in the cavern behind you. If there was
anything worth salvaging - it's gone now. Time to return back to Laura.&r
&7&o  C: Return to Laura with good news.

  &6[Scout Laura]&r
 Well? How'd it go? Do tell!
  &5[I found it. I blew it up!]&r
  &6[Scout Laura]&r
 Whoa, woah. I knew Kathryn's explosives were wild, but that!? Amazing. Thank you, truly! This will teach them a lesson. After
that, I can't just leave you empty-handed. I don't have much, but I entrust you my quiver, may it serve you well. Oh, and take
these tipped arrows too. You've earned it.
