Journey back into his workshop and see what you can find. Remember\nto bring some uncharged tesseracts with you.\n C:   &o  [2/2]: If you lost the journal from the Alnera Archives, you can find another one there.\n After you enter the cyan room: Table\n Distant Voice\n  &6[Distant Voice]\n Welcome back, Selari. It has been some time.\n  &6[Distant Voice]\n Would you like to play a game?\n  &5[Who's speaking?]\n  &6[Distant Voice]\n Have you forgotten me already?\n  &6[Distant Voice]\n I am an artificial mind, created by your hand.\n  &5[Uh... right. And why did I do that again?]\n  &6[Artificial Mind]\n To unlock the power of Mind, we shall face off in a battle of will. As such, these shall be the rules for our game:  Plain\nTurns shall be taken one at a time. I shall make the first move, followed by your's, and so on. Plain  A piece shall be moved\nacross this screen by turns, and can never return to a position it has already held. Plain  Position changes can only be made in\nL-shaped movements. That is, in movements of 2x1 or 1x2. Plain  The loser of a round is determined when a move can no longer be\nmade. If you are trapped and cannot progress, you have lost. Plain  You must defeat me in this game 3 consecutive times. Only\nthen will the power of Mind be unlocked.\n After beating the AI:\n After entering the purple room:\n   Table\n Caged Citizen\n  &6[Caged Citizen]\n Hey, you! Get me out of here! Please!\n  &5[How did you get here?]\n  &6[Caged Citizen]\n I... I don't know! I went to sleep one night, and when I woke up, I was here. There was this strange man, as well. Kept\nmumbling something about emotions. Proper creep.\n  &5[This cage doesn't seem to have a gate. Do you know of any way I can get you out?]\n  &6[Caged Citizen]\n No idea. This machine may have something to do with it. Maybe if you fire it up, it'll open?\n  &5[The configuration it wants doesn't seem mathematically possible.]\n  &6[Caged Citizen]\n Gah, are you saying I'm stuck here?!\n  &5[Do you happen to know anything about this machine?]\n  &6[Caged Citizen]\n Not really, it seemed liked that guy was pretty much done with it, so I've never seen it used... OH, I do remember him saying\nsomething though... It was a number... What was it... 102? Yeah that sounds right. Maybe that means something?\n Rules of the puzzle:  Plain  Two vessels for energy exist in this room - one can hold 5 units, the other, 3 units. Plain  In\norder to properly send energy to the subject, exactly 4 units of power must be transferred. Plain  However, the smaller vessel\nis unable to submit power to the subject, so all 4 units must come from the lager vessel. Plain  5 chages of power exist within\nthe system for consumption.\n After completing the puzzle:\n PRIMEVAL CREATIONS VI COMPLETE!
