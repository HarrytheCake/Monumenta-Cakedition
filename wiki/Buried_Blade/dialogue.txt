 Ahh, Octavius told me 'bout ya. Said you'd do just 'bout anything for the right price. Well, I've got somethings what need
doin' and some coin, whadda ya say?
  &5[Make it a lot of coin.]
  &6[BlackJack Stan]
 Hah, well said. There's a cave in the nearby mesa where I keep my, ah, 'legally acquired' goods. But a gravel cave-in buried my
goods and there's too many spiders down there! By now, most of my goods have rotted, but there's an antique sword still in
there. Bring me that sword back and there's a bag o' loot in it for ya. Here, take this key, you'll need it to get in.
  &5[Take Key]
  &5[Not now, I'm busy.]
  &6[Blackjack Stan]
 Then quit wasting my time and go bother someone else! I'm a busy man.
&o  [1/3]: Head to the   Link   Overgrown Cave Overgrown_Cave wikilink to being your search.
&o  [2/3]: A cave-in caused gravel to block the way. Clear it out and find the sword. [158, 76, -29]
&o  [3/3]: Once you find the blade return it to Blackjack Stan for your reward. There might also be an alternative NPC that
