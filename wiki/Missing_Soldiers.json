For good reasons of course; he called you a 'paragon of virtue.' Care to put that virtuousness to good use?  \n  &5[What do you need help with?]  \n  &6[Sergeant Sigrun] \n Scout Corporals Davis and Redmond were spying on the Jaguar Warrior village across the river, southeast of here. They can handle themselves, but should be back by now. If you could head over there and make sure they're... doing well, it would put me at ease. \n  &5[Sorry, I need to get going]  \n  &6[Sergeant Sigrun] \n Alright, that's no problem. You're not a soldier, you have no obligation to help.

I guess I'll find out when we go and burn that village to the ground. \n  &6[Sergeant Sigrun] \n I'll start seeing how many troops we have available, but while I do that, there's another jaguar warrior village we had under surveillance to the east.
