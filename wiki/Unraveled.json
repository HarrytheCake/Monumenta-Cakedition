Table  AlignDefault ColWidthDefault AlignDefault \n Bhairavi \n  Coordinates: [-279 867-652] \n   &6[Bhairavi] \n So, what have you been doing since we got set up, [Player]? \n  &5[A lot. I started a war, won a war, got the Blue Wool, and had it stolen by Calder.] \n  &6[Bhairavi] \n Excuse me? He's here for sure? He took a wool from you? \n  &5[I'm sorry I've been running solo recently. Just a lot happening at once and a lot of trust to win.] \n  &6[Bhairavi] \n That's okay, we just need to get on this now. Do you have any leads? \n  &5[The Shadowcast Bastille, not far from Galengarde.] \n  &6[Izzy] \n Sorry to interrupt, but why there? \n  &5[The Galengarde Primarium said Calder had met with them in disguise. They tasked him to clear it out and then never saw him again.] \n  &6[Bhairavi] \n That seems as good a place as ever to start then. Are we expecting Masked resistance? \n  &5[I sure am. And I'm ready.] \n  &6[Levyn] \n ...Do ye think Samwell'll be there? \n  &5[I don't know. He could be anywhere by now.] \n  &6[Levyn] \n I be hopin' that bastard be. He needs ta pay...! \n  &5[Let's get started.] \n  &6[Bhairavi] \n We'll meet you in the Bastille then. Good luck.  \n&o  C: Find a way deeper into the Shadowcast Bastille. \n After reaching   Link   Masquerader's Ruin Masquerader's_Ruin wikilink lobby: \n&o  C: Talk with your allies. Table  AlignDefault ColWidthDefault AlignDefault \n Bhairavi (MR Lobby) AlignDefault \n  &6[Bhairavi] \n Yep, looks like Calder and his crew have been setting up here. We\u2019re in the right place. \n  &5[Do you think they\u2019re keeping the wool here though?] \n  &6[Izzy] \n Yeah this place is really close to Galengarde. That seems reckless. \n  &6[Samwell] \n Sorry for the disappointment, mates. It was the best place we could get. Spent ages clearing this place out and setting up safeguards; shoulda figured the Behemoth wouldn\u2019t be enough for you lot on the warpath. \n  &5[Samwell??] \n  &6[Levyn] \n Why\u2026 ye traitorous scum! Get ye gone  \n&o  C: Enter the   Link   Masquerader's Ruin Masquerader's_Ruin wikilink  . \n After beating the strike: \n&o  C: Speak with your allies following Samwell's defeat. Table  AlignDefault ColWidthDefault AlignDefault \n Bhairavi (MR Lobby) AlignDefault \n  &6[Bhairavi] \n It\u2019s over. We\u2019ve got the wool back. I feel like we\u2019re gonna be finding little shards of it all over the fortress for weeks, but I\u2019ll organize a team to get it done. The wool will be complete again in no time. \n  &5[What were they even doing down there with it?] \n  &6[Bhairavi] \n The same thing Calder\u2019s been doing to the Black wool. Sharding it. They were trying to use magic to split it into tiny pieces to distribute its power. \n  &5[To power up his Masked even more?] \n  &6[Bhairavi] \n No, I think he was going to share the wool into little bits and then destroy the bits. See if that didn\u2019t let a full spirit out or something. \n  &5[Would it\u2026 would it work?] \n  &6[Bhairavi] \n Somehow, I doubt it. Teal and Crimson were spirits. I don\u2019t think releasing the spirit a bit at a time would have stopped the spirit from reforming as more and more got out. But I can\u2019t say for sure. \n  &5[We might never know\u2026 So how do we keep the wool safe?] \n  &6[Bhairavi] \n Hang onto it for now. Try not to get jumped again? Once we figure out where the Monument is in the Ring, we should be able to store it there...
