 Hello there, welcome to Farr. Keep an eye out while you're here; rogues and monsters surround this town, but we'll keep you
safe within the walls. And tell me, do you have a bit of free time?
  &5[I do have time]
  &5[I'm busy]
  Color|orange|[Captain Tobias]
 Glad to hear it. Now, are you familiar with the Axtan Monastery, up in the Jaguar Tooth Mountains?
  &5[I've been there]
  &5[Never heard of it]
  Color|orange|[Captain Tobias]
 Good, means you won't need directions. The Monks up there normally come to town every week, trading ale and books for food and
tools. We haven't seen them in twelve days. I've heard some bad rumors that make me nervous, so could you go check on them?
  &5[Absolutely]
  &5[Not right now]
  Color|orange|[Captain Tobias]
 Splendid. Head up north, make sure the monks are fine and assist if they are not, and then report back.
&o  The Axtan Monks haven't been heard from lately. Captain Tobias asks that you see if they're alright. Head to the   Link

 Help! Druids are attacking our monastery and are casting a dark spell! Please slay the Sons of the Forest before they can
finish their ritual!
&o  Slay the druids until dialog appears in chat:  You feel the dark magic of the Sons of the Forest lift from the monastery!
&o  Speak with Abbott Johann
  Color|ORANGE|[Abbot Johann]
 Bless you warrior! I felt the influence of that shadowy spell lift from us. Now go, hurry back to Farr and warn Captain Tobias
that the Sons of the Forest have risen again and are trying to steal secrets most ancient.
