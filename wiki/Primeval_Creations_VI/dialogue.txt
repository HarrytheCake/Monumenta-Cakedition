 Distant Voice
  &6[Distant Voice]
 Welcome back, Selari. It has been some time.
  &6[Distant Voice]
 Would you like to play a game?
  &5[Who's speaking?]
  &6[Distant Voice]
 Have you forgotten me already?
  &6[Distant Voice]
 I am an artificial mind, created by your hand.
  &5[Uh... right. And why did I do that again?]
  &6[Artificial Mind]
 To unlock the power of Mind, we shall face off in a battle of will. As such, these shall be the rules for our game:  Plain
Turns shall be taken one at a time. I shall make the first move, followed by your's, and so on. Plain  A piece shall be moved
across this screen by turns, and can never return to a position it has already held. Plain  Position changes can only be made in
L-shaped movements. That is, in movements of 2x1 or 1x2. Plain  The loser of a round is determined when a move can no longer be
made. If you are trapped and cannot progress, you have lost. Plain  You must defeat me in this game 3 consecutive times. Only
then will the power of Mind be unlocked.

 Caged Citizen
  &6[Caged Citizen]
 Hey, you! Get me out of here! Please!
  &5[How did you get here?]
  &6[Caged Citizen]
 I... I don't know! I went to sleep one night, and when I woke up, I was here. There was this strange man, as well. Kept
mumbling something about emotions. Proper creep.
  &5[This cage doesn't seem to have a gate. Do you know of any way I can get you out?]
  &6[Caged Citizen]
 No idea. This machine may have something to do with it. Maybe if you fire it up, it'll open?
  &5[The configuration it wants doesn't seem mathematically possible.]
  &6[Caged Citizen]
 Gah, are you saying I'm stuck here?!
  &5[Do you happen to know anything about this machine?]
  &6[Caged Citizen]
 Not really, it seemed liked that guy was pretty much done with it, so I've never seen it used... OH, I do remember him saying
something though... It was a number... What was it... 102? Yeah that sounds right. Maybe that means something?
 Rules of the puzzle:  Plain  Two vessels for energy exist in this room - one can hold 5 units, the other, 3 units. Plain  In
order to properly send energy to the subject, exactly 4 units of power must be transferred. Plain  However, the smaller vessel
is unable to submit power to the subject, so all 4 units must come from the lager vessel. Plain  5 chages of power exist within
the system for consumption.
