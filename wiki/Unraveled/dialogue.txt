 So, what have you been doing since we got set up, [Player]?
  &5[A lot. I started a war, won a war, got the Blue Wool, and had it stolen by Calder.]&r
  &6[Bhairavi]&r
 Excuse me? He's here for sure? He took a wool from you?
  &5[I'm sorry I've been running solo recently. Just a lot happening at once and a lot of trust to win.]&r
  &6[Bhairavi]&r
 That's okay, we just need to get on this now. Do you have any leads?
  &5[The Shadowcast Bastille, not far from Galengarde.]&r
  &6[Izzy]&r
 Sorry to interrupt, but why there?
  &5[The Galengarde Primarium said Calder had met with them in disguise. They tasked him to clear it out and then never saw him
again.]&r
  &6[Bhairavi]&r
 That seems as good a place as ever to start then. Are we expecting Masked resistance?
  &5[I sure am. And I'm ready.]&r
  &6[Levyn]&r
 ...Do ye think Samwell'll be there?
  &5[I don't know. He could be anywhere by now.]&r
  &6[Levyn]&r
 I be hopin' that bastard be. He needs ta pay...!
  &5[Let's get started.]&r
  &6[Bhairavi]&r
 We'll meet you in the Bastille then. Good luck.
&7&o  C: Find a way deeper into the Shadowcast Bastille.

  &6[Bhairavi]&r
 Yep, looks like Calder and his crew have been setting up here. We’re in the right place.
  &5[Do you think they’re keeping the wool here though?]&r
  &6[Izzy]&r
 Yeah this place is really close to Galengarde. That seems reckless.
  &6[Samwell]&r
 Sorry for the disappointment, mates. It was the best place we could get. Spent ages clearing this place out and setting up
safeguards; shoulda figured the Behemoth wouldn’t be enough for you lot on the warpath.
  &5[Samwell??]&r
  &6[Levyn]&r
 Why… ye traitorous scum! Get ye gone
&7&o  C: Enter the   Link   Masquerader's Ruin Masquerader's_Ruin wikilink  .
 After beating the strike:
&7&o  C: Speak with your allies following Samwell's defeat.

 It’s over. We’ve got the wool back. I feel like we’re gonna be finding little shards of it all over the fortress for weeks, but
I’ll organize a team to get it done. The wool will be complete again in no time.
  &5[What were they even doing down there with it?]&r
  &6[Bhairavi]&r
 The same thing Calder’s been doing to the Black wool. Sharding it. They were trying to use magic to split it into tiny pieces
to distribute its power.
  &5[To power up his Masked even more?]&r
  &6[Bhairavi]&r
 No, I think he was going to share the wool into little bits and then destroy the bits. See if that didn’t let a full spirit out
or something.
  &5[Would it… would it work?]&r
  &6[Bhairavi]&r
 Somehow, I doubt it. Teal and Crimson were spirits. I don’t think releasing the spirit a bit at a time would have stopped the
spirit from reforming as more and more got out. But I can’t say for sure.
  &5[We might never know… So how do we keep the wool safe?]&r
  &6[Bhairavi]&r
 Hang onto it for now. Try not to get jumped again? Once we figure out where the Monument is in the Ring, we should be able to
store it there... I hope.
