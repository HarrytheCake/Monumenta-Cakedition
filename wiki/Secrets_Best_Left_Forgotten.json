No one will confirm anything, but you can tell by the way people carry themselves here, speaking of people who, as far as the official records show, never existed. If my hunch is correct, something is being covered up, something big that caused people to go missing. \n  Color|purple|[That's odd.

Well, I... \n  Color|purple|[Anything to say on it?]}} \n  Color|orange|[Record Keeper Shani]}} \n Listen, there is something to that story, but I can't say much or Amarion will have me sacked.

I can't keep this a secret forever- Amarion be damned! \n  Color|purple|[What happened here?]}} \n  Color|orange|[Foreman Boris]}} \n Well, some years back, we lost miners- a lot of miners- to this cursed Basanite mission. If this had gotten out, our town would be out of business, and Alnera would have our heads. So we had to keep it a secret. Amarion came up with that idea, of course... \n  Color|purple|[I'm not entirely sure they are dead. I went to Basanite, and I think they somehow reached out to me, begging for help to escape.]}} \n  Color|orange|[Foreman Boris]}} \n I... I don't understand how that could be. We saw them die... We... we collapsed the entrance and sealed it off because we knew they were gone... No, please don't tell me we trapped them inside of that place. Damn you Amarion!
