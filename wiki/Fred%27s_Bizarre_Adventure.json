Yes actually, there's also a powerful seal keeping the area inaccessible. \n  Color|purple|[Would you like some help?]}} \n  Color|orange|[Fred]}} \n Hmm, I've not hired an assistant in a while... not since the accident that, uh... terminated my last one... So sure, why not! You're hired! \n  Color|purple|[So what's the plan?]}} \n  Color|orange|[Fred]}} \n Here's a little catch up on my research so far. After some careful study on the seal that prevents forward progress, I have found that it might be possible to counter the magical frequency using a Silvic Crystal. \n  Color|orange|[Fred]}} \n Since I'm sure you've brushed up on your geology like all good assistants do, you likely know that Silvic Crystals are exceedingly rare. In fact, the only place I even know they can be found is an area in the west known as the Crystalline Vault, though not many people are brave enough to attempt to enter. \n  Color|purple|[So in short, find the magic crystal in the dangerous vault?]}} \n  Color|orange|[Fred]}} \n As sharp as I would expect!
