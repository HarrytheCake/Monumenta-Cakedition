 Hmm... Are you, by any chance, [Player]?
  &5[Uh, stranger danger!]
  &6[Safar]
 Fine, the Trade didn't need your help anyways...
  &5[Yeah... How do you know my name?]
  &6[Safar]
 I have heard tale of your good deeds from Riaz in Rahkeri...
  &5[Oh, it wasn't a big deal. Helping people is what I do.]
  &6[Safar]
 Good, good... Well, the Trade requires your assistance. In a matter of business...
  He darts his eyes back and forth to make sure no-one is watching...
  &5[I'm actually quite preoccupied at the moment.]
  &6[Safar]
 Figures...
  &5[Okay...What do you guys need help with?]
  &6[Safar]
 Well you see, a client of ours is refusing to act on his end of a deal. We require you to retrieve our goods from him...
&o  C: Ask Safar what The Trade wants with you. Table

  &6[Safar]
 Are you ready to begin?
  &5[No, I'm busy at the moment.]
  &6[Safar]
 Return to me once you're free...
  &5[Yes, where should I go to retrieve your items?]
  &6[Safar]
 A house towards the outskirts here has a basement, in that basement you should find our goods. Return them to us... Be careful
[Player] - I am unsure what security measures the client has.
  He gives you a swift nod.
&o  C: Search for the client's house in Molta, once inside find the basement access hatch. Solve the puzzle and get the message
inside.

 Have you found the Ishnir Trade's goods?
  &5[Unfortunately not - the client didn't have them in his basement. However, he did have this.]
  &6[Safar]
 Let me see that...
  &5[So, does that help?]
  &6[Safar]
 Yes, it helps tremendously, actually. This is an encoded set of coordinates to a location where our client has hidden a stash
of supplies.
  Color|gray|He looks up from the book.
  &5[Oh! So where do they lead?]
  &6[Safar]
 They appear to lead to an area named the "Magmashroom Mines". Look for some exposed stone bricks, which might indicate where
the stash is.
  &5[I'm on it!]
  &6[Safar]
 Good luck, [Player].
&o  C: [1/2]: Travel to   Link   Magmashroom Mines Magmashroom_Mine wikilink in order to find the client's stash. Be on the
lookout for stone bricks.

 Fantastic! [Player], you have been a great help to the Ishnir Trade. We will not forget what you have done to help us...

  &5[No problem!]
