   &6[Safar]&r
 Hmm... Are you, by any chance, [Player]?
  &5[Uh, stranger danger!]&r
  &6[Safar]&r
 Fine, the Trade didn't need your help anyways...
  &5[Yeah... How do you know my name?]&r
  &6[Safar]&r
 I have heard tale of your good deeds from Riaz in Rahkeri...
  &5[Oh, it wasn't a big deal. Helping people is what I do.]&r
  &6[Safar]&r
 Good, good... Well, the Trade requires your assistance. In a matter of business...
  &8He darts his eyes back and forth to make sure no-one is watching...&r
  &5[I'm actually quite preoccupied at the moment.]&r
  &6[Safar]&r
 Figures...
  &5[Okay...What do you guys need help with?]&r
  &6[Safar]&r
 Well you see, a client of ours is refusing to act on his end of a deal. We require you to retrieve our goods from him...
&7&o  C: Ask Safar what The Trade wants with you.
 Safar
  &6[Safar]&r
 Are you ready to begin?
  &5[No, I'm busy at the moment.]&r
  &6[Safar]&r
 Return to me once you're free...
  &5[Yes, where should I go to retrieve your items?]&r
  &6[Safar]&r
 A house towards the outskirts here has a basement, in that basement you should find our goods. Return them to us... Be careful
[Player] - I am unsure what security measures the client has.
  &8He gives you a swift nod.&r
&7&o  C: Search for the client's house in Molta, once inside find the basement access hatch. Solve the puzzle and get the
message inside.

 &7&o  C: Return to Safar to see if he can decode the message.

  &6[Safar]&r
 Have you found the Ishnir Trade's goods?
  &5[Unfortunately not - the client didn't have them in his basement. However, he did have this.]&r
  &6[Safar]&r
 Let me see that...
  &r
  &5[So, does that help?]&r
  &6[Safar]&r
 Yes, it helps tremendously, actually. This is an encoded set of coordinates to a location where our client has hidden a stash
of supplies.
  &8He looks up from the book.&r
  &5[Oh! So where do they lead?]&r
  &6[Safar]&r
 They appear to lead to an area named the "Magmashroom Mines". Look for some exposed stone bricks, which might indicate where
the stash is.
  &5[I'm on it!]&r
  &6[Safar]&r
 Good luck, [Player].
&7&o  C: [1/2]: Travel to   Link   Magmashroom Mines Magmashroom_Mine wikilink in order to find the client's stash. Be on the
lookout for stone bricks.
&7&o  C: [2/2]: Once you have the stash return to Safar.
 Safar
  &6[Safar]&r
 So, have you retrieved the items?
  &5[You bet!]&r
  &6[Safar]&r
 Fantastic! [Player], you have been a great help to the Ishnir Trade. We will not forget what you have done to help us...
  &8He smiles at you.&r
  &5[No problem!]&r
  &6[Safar]&r
 We believe a reward is in order: here, take this... The Amulet here will allow you to be recognized by my superior.
  &3'''DEALBREAKER COMPLETE!'''&r
  &3Awarded the [[Amulet of the Trade]] and the trust of the Ishnir Trade!&r
