Nice to see you again.  \n  &5[How have you been doing?]  \n  &6[Nelfine] \n Just fine! My memories are still kinda fuzzy in some areas, but they are slowly coming back to me. I just wish Arian would finally write me back. I hope he hasn't gotten himself into too much trouble looking for me. \n  &5[Do you happen to have another copy of that book?] \n  &5[Why are you still here, Nelfine?]  \n  &6[Nelfine] \n I didn't want to move too far until I got my response from Arian. \n  &5[He still hasn't sent a response?] \n  &6[Nelfine] \n No. I'm getting slightly worried. I hope he hasn't gotten himself into too much trouble. I can't imagine how much stress he must have been in for the last few weeks, with my disappearance and all. \n  &5[Where did you say he was located?] \n  &6[Nelfine] \n He is stationed at Highwatch. His office is located in the tower directly north of the entrance, second floor, I believe. \n  &5[I'll head there now and ask him.] \n  &6[Nelfine] \n Thank you so much!  \n&o  Head to Arian's office on the second floor of the northwest tower in Highwatch.

If you're a scout through and through, I've got equipment that might interest you, if you've got the right coin. \n  &5[I was told that this was Arian's office] \n  &6[Scoutmaster Ursan] \n Arian? Now, who could have told you that? This hasn't been his office in the better part of 15 years. They moved his office to the keep, and that's where he remained until he resigned. \n  &5[Resigned?] \n  &6[Scoutmaster Ursan] \n Yeah, just about a week ago. No warning or anything. Told everyone he could no longer be here, and left without telling us where he was going. He didn't even take the time to pack up his office. \n  &5[Which office is his?] \n  &6[Scoutmaster Ursan] \n Well, it's on the ground floor, but he sealed it off as he left. Arian has always been very secretive about his work. Only the higher ups here were allowed to know what he was doing. Knowing him, though, I can't imagine that he left himself with no way in.  \n&o  Find a way into Arian's office in the Highwatch Keep and see what you can find. \n  To get into Arian's office. Press the button near the top of the stairs at [1180, 145, -128]. \n Then a piston door will open up in the bookshelf at [1189, 136, -136]. \n  After you enter the office: \n  &6[Shady Thief] \n ...finally, the old man's secrets will belong to...

You're the one that sent that damn letter, aren't you? Who are you? What have I done to make you want to torture me like this? \n  &5[No, Nelfine sent me that letter. I came because you never responded.] \n  &6[Arian] \n NELFINE IS DEAD! \n&o RawInline  color|teal|Arian slumps back in his seat \n  &6[Arian] \n I don't know who you are, or where you heard that name from, but the woman you speak of has been dead for 30 years. Go take a look at the memorial if you don't believe me. \n  &5[She isn't dead. She's been stuck in a holding cell under Sierhaven for a few weeks.] \n  &6[Arian] \n A few weeks? Then explain to me where she's been for the rest of the 30 years. If you are going to lie to me, at least know your facts. \n  &5[I'm... I'm not lying to you Arian. She specifically told me it had only been a few weeks.] \n  &6[Arian] \n Please. Please quit making me suffer like this. \n  &5[I don't understand...] \n  &6[Arian] \n Nor do I. \n&o RawInline  color|teal|You don't think you will be able to get Arian to listen to you anymore, you should return to Nelfine  \n&o  Arian doesn't seem to believe you.

It's me, [Player].] \n  &6[Nelfine] \n I'm sorry, but I never get visitors here. Every now and then, I'll hear a voice in here, proper creepy-like. \n  &5[Something is wrong. Why do you not remember who I am?] \n  &6[Nelfine] \n If I had to guess, it's likely because we've never met. \n  &5[I need to go back to Arian. Something is really wrong here.] \n  &6[Nelfine] \n Arian, you say? I don't know who that is, but there was this note lying at my feet with that name on it.

She just can't remember anything.] \n  &6[Arian] \n How did she remember enough to write me a letter then? \n  &5[I restored her memory with a device I found. It seems the effects were only temporary.] \n  &6[Arian] \n Well then. Go use that device again. Restore her memory again, and then bring me to her.  \n&o  Find your way back to the Overgrown Laboratory and see if you can restore Nelfine's memories once again. \n  Coordinates: [336, 75, 309] \n &o  The old lab has been destroyed!

Well, she's quite fine. I wouldn't dare hurt her... yet... \n  &5[Who are you?] \n  &6[Virius] \n I am a researcher of certain... magical phenomena. But for all intents and purposes, I am known as Virius. \n  &5[What do you want with Nelfine?] \n  &6[Virius] \n Isn't it obvious? I want what she can no longer remember. I need her memories. \n  &5[Why would you need her memories?] \n  &6[Virius] \n Because she was there on that day, the day Farr was attacked. She was present during the explosion, and more importantly, she survived, meaning she saw what occurred afterwards. But none of this is your concern for the moment. My new device will be able to extract everything I need. \n  &5[You aren't going to do anything to her.] \n  &6[Virius] \n Oh, you're quite right. I'm not, you are. This machine requires two people, one person whose mind is being probed, and one who is doing the probing. Obviously I can't risk my own life with something as dangerous as this. \n  &5[What makes you think I'm going to do that?] \n  &6[Virius] \n What makes you believe you have a choice? Now you get to do as all good adventurers do, meddle in other people's lives. Good luck.
