Hey, I have a question though... \n  &5[What is it?] \n  &6[Buildmaster Jr.] \n I've noticed a weird button in my dad's house here, and Aimee next door mentioned one in her home as well. Do you know anything about it? \n  &5[I'll check them out, I guess.

Probably a few weeks. \n  &5[Who are you?] \n  &6[Nelfine] \n My name is Nelfine, but that's about as much as I can tell you. \n  &5[What do you mean?] \n  &6[Nelfine] \n Well as I said, I have been here for a while, but the thing is, I can't quite tell you how. I just woke up here one day with almost none of my memory intact. I've heard a voice speak to me a few times, proper creepy-like. I also found a notebook stuffed into the corner. \n  &5[Do you mind if I see that book?] \n  &6[Nelfine] \n Sure, I have no use for it.
