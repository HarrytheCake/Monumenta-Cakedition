And you've already run into one of the most\ncorrupt me plaguing Sierhaven.\n  &5[Who?]\n  &5[Octavius.]\n  &5[Levyn.]\n  &6[Argent]\n No. Octavius is the threat. He and his Five Axes company smuggle weapons and protect all manner of filth from prosecution. Do\nme a favor, walk to the edge of the tower and look at his booth.\n  &6[Argent]\n Looks so innocuous doesn't it? But he has money and political protection far beyond his means, and we're not sure who he's\nworking for. But now we have an opportunity.\n  &5[What opportunity?]\n  &6[Argent]\n Carlton, the former accountant of the Five Axes Trading Company has left.

Now, Octavius?]\n  &6[Carlton]\n O-of course. All of his financial records are kept in a warehouse in Farr, that should tell you everything you need. There's a\nbasement with a vault in it, but you have to solve a maze to get there. I don't know all the tricks, but I remember hearing to\n'follow the shadows'. I hope that helps you bring him in.\n&o  Find your way through the maze beneath the Five Axes Trading Co warehouse. You should start by following the shadows.\n  When you get into the basement, to go through the maze follow the path without torches.\n Directions: S S W W N W W S S E E S W S W W N N.\n Enter the door and talk to the parrot.\n  Polly\n  &6[Polly]\n Squawk!

Now, hand over the ledger.\n  &5[Here, take the ledgers.]\n  &6[Duchess Emmeline]\n Well thank you, I was worried there was going to be bloodshed but this was much simpler.

Well, at least now we know who's been backing Octavius.\n  &5[The ledgers were taken.]\n  &6[Argent]\n It may not be the outcome we wanted, but you nonetheless aided the Order of Glass.
