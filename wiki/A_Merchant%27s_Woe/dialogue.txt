&7&o  Talk to Riaz's supplier to see where his goods are.
 Riaz
  Coordinates: [-98, 154, 459]
   &6[Riaz]&r
 Oh dear me.... I still haven't received my supply package yet! It's been days!
  &5[Hello! Is there anything I can do to help?]&r
  &8The man seems quite worried...&r
  &6[Riaz]&r
 Why yes! Say... Could you check on my supplier? He has probably arrived and is at a small, spruce outpost overlooking the
canyon by now. Ask him if he has my goods!
  &5[Actually, there's something that came up...]&r
  &6[Riaz]&r
 Oh darn it. Well, I guess I'll have to wait on him then.
  &5[Sure, I'd be happy to help!]&r
  &6[Riaz]&r
 Fantastic! Be sure to bring the goods back to me!
&7&o  C: Go check on Riaz's supplier at the outpost. You can not get to it from   Link   Cinder's Roost Cinder's_Roost wikilink
directly, but the entrance is in the valley below it.
 Supplier Anebos
  Coordinates: For house: [116, 79, 639] For Npc: [127, 77, 632]
   &8The man seems to be very stressed... He looks like the right guy!&r
  &5[Hello? Are you Riaz's supplier?]&r
  &6[Supplier Anebos]&r
 Oh no! Has he found out already? I'm in so much trouble!
  &5[Why? What happened?]&r
  &6[Supplier Anebos]&r
 Well, you see, I've... lost the goods that I was supposed to have delivered to him a couple days ago!
  &5[Any idea where you lost them?]&r
  &6[Supplier Anebos]&r
 Perhaps in Rockspider Cavern? My cart felt a lot lighter after I left there...
  &5[Alright. Thank you for your help!]&r
  &6[Supplier Anebos]&r
 I hope you find them!
&7&o  C: [1/2]: Retrieve the supplies from   Link   Rockspider Cavern Rockspider_Cavern wikilink  .
&7&o  C: [2/2]: Once you have the supplies return to Riaz.
 Riaz
  &6[Riaz]&r
 By Ishnir! You did it! You've retrieved them!
  &5[All in a days work!]&r
  &6[Riaz]&r
 Thank you so much! Now I'll be able to run my business again! Here, take this as a thank you from me.
  &6[Riaz]&r
 What did you say your name was? [Player]? Thank you again- you're welcome here anytime!
