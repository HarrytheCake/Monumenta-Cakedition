 Oh dear me.... I still haven't received my supply package yet! It's been days!
  &5[Hello! Is there anything I can do to help?]
  The man seems quite worried...
  &6[Riaz]
 Why yes! Say... Could you check on my supplier? He has probably arrived and is at a small, spruce outpost overlooking the
canyon by now. Ask him if he has my goods!
  &5[Actually, there's something that came up...]
  &6[Riaz]
 Oh darn it. Well, I guess I'll have to wait on him then.
  &5[Sure, I'd be happy to help!]
  &6[Riaz]
 Fantastic! Be sure to bring the goods back to me!

  &6[Supplier Anebos]
 Oh no! Has he found out already? I'm in so much trouble!
  &5[Why? What happened?]
  &6[Supplier Anebos]
 Well, you see, I've... lost the goods that I was supposed to have delivered to him a couple days ago!
  &5[Any idea where you lost them?]
  &6[Supplier Anebos]
 Perhaps in Rockspider Cavern? My cart felt a lot lighter after I left there...
  &5[Alright. Thank you for your help!]

 I hope you find them!
