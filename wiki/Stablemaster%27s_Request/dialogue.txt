 Yeehaw! Two down, one to go! The final horse breed, if this book is correct, should reside in an area with large amounts of
water. Sounds like the Oasis to me! It also mentions a spring sandwiched between the   Link   Charred Arcanery Charred_Arcanery
wikilink and   Link   Palm Tree Paradise Palm_Tree_Paradise wikilink  .
  &5[Okay, I'll head there next!]&r
