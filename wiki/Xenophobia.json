I've managed to get it to emit the same energy that it did the first time we used it. I believe it might actually be able to take us somewhere again.

I seem to remember that portion of the ocean being particularly islandless, if the maps are correct. I can't imagine where they could be meeting.

I suppose we can forget about Samwell then, but we need Levyn, especially if you aren't entirely sure where we are heading in the south west.
