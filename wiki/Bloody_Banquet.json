Did she install a new chandelier?

This much is nothing to her.  Table  AlignDefault ColWidthDefault AlignDefault \n Susan AlignDefault \n  &6[Susan] \n The Countess recently expanded her business to the Celsian Isles. She\u2019s known for having multiple successful ventures. She's so impressive. \n  &5[What kind of business does she do?] \n  &6[Susan] \n Oh, she does a variety of things like I said before. Science, art, weapons, food, construction\u2026 she\u2019s a seriously wealthy woman. I'm not here for business though, the Countess asked me to come because I recently visited Lier... \n  &5[Lier?

How shameless could she get! \n  &5[How is she shameless? She was sick!] \n  &6[Jerry] \n That was probably her guilty conscious finally getting to her! She begged the Countess for months to invite her to one of her functions.

Even if you don't know my name, you\u2019ve probably seen my work. \n  &5[What kind of work do you do?] \n  &6[Alyssa] \n I see I've caught your attention!

A new face is welcome. \n  &5[All the people here seem to be here for business.]  \n  &6[Countess Corinne] \n I have been told I have an eye for potential. I've had immense success with all my businesses so many people flock to me in hopes they can also share that success. Not everyone here is like that though.

I've heard a lot of good things about you so I kept an eye on you during the entire banquet. \n  &5[Keeping an eye on me?] \n  &6[Guard Timmeh] \n And a good thing too. I think it's safe to say that you aren't the one who killed the Countess. You were out here where I could see you the whole time. The others however... \n  &5[What are you going to do then?] \n  &6[Guard Timmeh] \n Nobody will be allowed to leave the banquet until we find the killer, I'm keeping an eye out on the crime scene so that nobody tampers with the evidence. I can't be two places at once, but if I stand here then I can't properly investigate the murder... Could you help me?  \n  &5[Sorry, I don't think I'm cut out for this.]  \n  &6[Guard Timmeh] \n Alright then, just sit tight until we solve this then. \n  &5[Sure!] \n  &6[Guard Timmeh] \n That would help a lot!

Keep up the good work! \n  &6[Guard Timmeh] \n We should look for the weapon that was used to kill the Countess. Find it and use this on it. It's a kit that will hopefully get a fingerprint from the weapon. \n  &6[Guard Timmeh] \n We will need a fingerprint from the murder weapon. Oh- and if you can, go around and see if you can get some fingerprints from things that people have touched. If we find a match then it will be easier to narrow the suspect list down.

Can you believe that?! \n  &5[Where were you before the Countess was murdered?]  \n  &6[Catherine] \n Oh god. Alyssa was yapping my ear off about how the curtains were too yellow. I'm so glad that Riley came by and distracted her with something else. She complained for what seemed like hours! \n  &5[What was your relationship with the Countess?]  \n  &6[Catherine] \n The Countess is a famous businesswoman from the Narsen Empire, but has been expanding her business to the Celsian Isles. I was one of her first contacts. She sponsored my fishing business in Frostgate. \n  &5[Have you and the Countess had any disputes recently?]  \n  &6[Catherine] \n Not in particular. Well...

Does that count? \n  &5[Where were you before the Countess was murdered?]  \n  &6[Alex] \n I was trying to talk to Catherine, but Alyssa came up to her and drowned me out with her obnoxious blabber about curtains. \n  &5[What was your relationship with the Countess?]  \n  &6[Alex] \n The Countess introduced me to Tirich, and I helped them with setting up their mining operation here. \n  &5[Have you and the Countess had any disputes recently?]  \n  &6[Alex] \n We've never fought.

I was going to ask her why she would draw when she could socialize with everyone else in the Main Hall, but she disappeared. \n  &5[Where were you before the Countess was murdered?]  \n  &6[Tirich] \n Me? I was in the Main Hall admiring the paintings. There was a smudge on Lady Corinne\u2019s portrait so I cleaned it. \n  &5[What was your relationship with the Countess?]  \n  &6[Tirich] \n She invested in my mining business. It used to be extremely successful but one of my mines shut down and I\u2019ve been struggling a bit since then. The Countess has been very kind and understanding of my situation. I\u2026 am saddened by this loss because she was a very kind person. Many will miss her. \n  &5[Have you and the Countess had any disputes recently?]  \n  &6[Tirich] \n It was less of a dispute and more of a worry of mine... You see, my father used to run an opal mining operation in King's Valley, but used them to practice black magic. The Countess is also a Narsen citizen so she knows of the crimes of my father... When she found out that my mining operation in Ishnir was mainly harvesting opals, I thought she was going to flip and stop supporting me. But... she simply accepted it and continued to support me...

I hope they find the killer soon\u2026 They\u2019re among us and that\u2019s so nerve wracking!  \n  &5[Have you seen anyone suspicious?]  \n  &6[Jared] \n I saw Tirich in the Main Hall taking notes in a Well Worn Journal. I don\u2019t know what he was writing but he was staring at each person and then writing some things. Honestly it was a bit concerning\u2026 \n  &5[Where were you before the Countess was murdered?]  \n  &6[Jared] \n I was in the Kitchen looking for a snack. I had one too many glasses of wine and was feeling peckish. I saw some deviled eggs on the counter and ate a good amount. Oh, I hope that there are enough for the rest... \n  &5[What was your relationship with the Countess?]  \n  &6[Jared] \n I'm a fairly popular designer that does work in the Isles as well as the Valley, even the late King Johannes III asked me to make some suits for him. While my designs are sought after by many, the Countess is probably my favorite patron because of her peculiar taste in clothes. She has a style that makes her stand out in the crowd. I was drawn to that so I offered to be her personal designer. \n  &5[Have you and the Countess had any disputes recently?]  \n  &6[Jared] \n Recently the Countess has been complaining that my designs are too extravagant so I've been getting frustrated with her. The last time we spoke before today, she told me to not come back until I made something that didn't look like I had glued the royal treasury onto a dress. So today I came here with a bunch of designs to show her!

I can't believe he can eat during a time like this! \n  &5[Where were you before the Countess was murdered?]  \n  &6[Terry] \n I was chatting with Tirich and admiring the paintings. \n  &5[What was your relationship with the Countess?]  \n  &6[Terry] \n She sponsored the business that my brother and I run. Honestly I don't know why she did... Ice cream in Chillwind... \n  &5[Have you and the Countess had any disputes recently?]  \n  &6[Terry] \n To my knowledge, nothing bad has happened.

Honestly! They provide fine wine and he decides to drink something else! He went out of my sight for a while and didn\u2019t have the canteen on him afterwards. \n  &5[Where were you before the Countess was murdered?]  \n  &6[Susan] \n I was in the Greenhouse admiring the lovely flowers that the Countess had grown. The begonias were so lovely I just had to pick a few--but don\u2019t tell the gardener! He\u2019ll definitely yell at me. \n  &5[What was your relationship with the Countess?]  \n  &6[Susan] \n She reached out to me because she was interested in taking a trip to the mountainous country Lier. I wasn't too keen on going back to Lier but eventually I agreed. I came here tonight because I wanted to plan the trip with her... \n  &5[Have you and the Countess had any disputes recently?]  \n  &6[Susan] \n Not really? We haven't known each other for a long time like some of the other people here. She's been interested in making connections in a new country for a while so when she heard from my father that I studied in Lier, she jumped on that and has been inviting me to her banquets non-stop. It's been exhausting, but I'd rather have her bother me than be dead...  Table  AlignDefault ColWidthDefault AlignDefault \n Alyssa AlignDefault \n  &6[Alyssa] \n Oh god...

But if I had to point out someone strange... Lady Susan was wearing a Gorgeous Brooch earlier but it was so last season\u2026 I mean---it was beautiful don\u2019t get me wrong, but when Sir Jared told her that it was last season, she cried and left for a bit. When I saw her next, she wasn\u2019t wearing the Gorgeous Brooch. \n  &5[Where were you before the Countess was murdered?]  \n  &6[Alyssa] \n I was talking to Lady Catherine about the curtains, they are an awful shade of mustard yellow and make the room feel more gaudy. I wish I could have told Cori that she needed to change the curtains before she... \n  &5[What was your relationship with the Countess?]  \n  &6[Alyssa] \n We were friends as children and she's been a good patron of mine ever since we became adults. \n  &5[Have you and the Countess had any disputes recently?]  \n  &6[Alyssa] \n We had a bit of a falling out because she had hired that witch Morina to paint her official portrait but I wanted to make up with her tonight. I acted immaturely because Morina and I have a fairly heated rivalry and I was angry because Cori knew this, but I understand why she asked Morina to paint her portrait. Her late father had asked Morina in the past to paint his portrait so she must have done so to honor his memory...

Wait, this is totally going to make the newspaper.  \n  &5[Have you seen anyone suspicious?]  \n  &6[Riley] \n I saw Terry shuffling around the room looking for his brother. He seemed pretty nervous. \n  &5[Where were you before the Countess was murdered?]  \n  &6[Riley] \n I was trying to sneak some snacks in before the banquet because I didn't know what they were going to serve. I'm not a picky eater but the last time I was at a banquet they served peacock. It was tasty but I lost my appetite thinking about it! \n  &5[What was your relationship with the Countess?]  \n  &6[Riley] \n When the Countess was still doing business in King's Valley, she hired me as her accountant. I moved from the Valley to Frostgate so that I could continue to assist her. \n  &5[Have you and the Countess had any disputes recently?]  \n  &6[Riley] \n The Countess recently hired an accountant from Ishnir to help with her businesses in the Isles, but he messed something up and blamed me. I cleared it up with her but man was she angry.  \n After talking to everyone: \n NOTE: If you pick the wrong person there is no consequence.

I don't think we have enough proof to say she's the killer.

Trust your gut. \n  &5[Jerry did it.]  \n  &6[Guard Timmeh] \nRawInline  color|red|So you think Jerry killed the Countess? \n  &6[Guard Timmeh] \n It looks like he was the owner of the Ornate Canteen, whose fingerprint matched the print we found on the murder weapon. He also lied about his whereabouts at the time of the murder. And finally, if you look at his attire, the Scrap of Cloth we found in the hand of the Countess matches his jacket. Based on the evidence you found, he's definitely the killer. Excellent work. I'll detain him immediately! \n  &5[Catherine did it.]  \n  &6[Guard Timmeh] \nRawInline  color|red|So you think Catherine killed the Countess? \n  &6[Guard Timmeh] \n I don't think you are right. None of the evidence we have so far leads us to believe she is involved. \n  &5[Riley did it.]  \n  &6[Guard Timmeh] \nRawInline  color|red|So you think Riley killed the Countess? \n  &6[Guard Timmeh] \n That sounds pretty far fetched. Maybe ask around some more... \n  &5[Terry did it.]  \n  &6[Guard Timmeh] \nRawInline  color|red|So you think Terry killed the Countess? \n  &6[Guard Timmeh] \n Hmm... You might be on to something, but I don't think you are on the right trail. \n  &5[Alex did it.]  \n  &6[Guard Timmeh] \nRawInline  color|red|So you think Alex killed the Countess? \n  &6[Guard Timmeh] \n Maybe we should retrace our steps.
