   &6[Archivist Saanavi]&r
 Welcome, welcome to the grand library, the greatest archive of knowledge in all of the Isles. Is there anything I can help you
with?
  &5[I'm looking for adventure!]&r
  &8Saanavi's eyes narrow.&r
  &6[Archivist Saanavi]&r
 I see. You are experienced in the arts of war and combat, correct?
  &5[Not particularly.]&r
  &6[Archivist Saanavi]&r
 Ah. Such a shame.
  &5[Very experienced, yes.]&r
  &6[Archivist Saanavi]&r
 Perfect. There is a student of the academy, as skilled as he is arrogant. His book is overdue. Kill him.
 ...
 ...
 Or, just get the book back. Either way.
  &5[This seems excessive. I'm out.]&r
  &6[Archivist Saanavi]&r
 Excessive!? Books are serious business.
  &5[Get the book, maybe murder someone. Got it.]&r
  &6[Archivist Saanavi]&r
 I knew I could count on you. He goes by Cypress. Like most of the older, more arrogant students, you won't find him in either
class or the library. Perhaps check the bar in town, that sounds precisely where book-hoarding scum would hang out.
&o  C: Find Cypress at the bar and ask him where the book is.
