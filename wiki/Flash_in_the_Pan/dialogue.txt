 Hey mate! You look like the kind of guy that runs a lot, wanna race?
  &5[What do you mean by 'race'?]&r
  &6[Flashy]&r
 You run, you TRY to beat my time, you win a prize if you succeed. Easy eh?
  &5[Let's give it a go!]&r
  &6[Flashy]&r
 That's what I like to hear! Wanna rundown of the rules, or do you just wanna go?
  &5[Let's go right now!]&r
  &6[Flashy]&r
 Here we go!
  &5[Sure, I'll listen to the rules.]&r
  &6[Flashy]&r
 Pretty simple stuff. Run through the rings you see. Every time you pass through one, you'll get a bit more time to get to the
next, and so on. You gotta reach the end with time still left, and if ya do, you beat my time!
  &5[Okay then, let's go!]&r
  &6[Flashy]&r
 Here we go!
  &5[I'm too tired of running...]&r
  &6[Flashy]&r
 You could have a future in racing, mate! Come back later for sure!
 After you beat the race:
  &6[Flashy]&r
