You look quite skilled, tell me, do you have any compunctions about killing thieves and ruffians?  \n  &5[None whatsoever]  \n  &6[Octavius] \n Wonderful! I am Octavius, head of the Five Axes Trading Company. Bandits have been harassing my caravans for a while now, and the City Guard is completely inept! Kill their leaders - of the bandits, not of the Guard, haha - and I will greatly reward you.  \n  &5[I'll do what I can]  \n  &6[Octavius] \n Simply Wonderful! The leaders are in two camps north of the city and fly black and brown banners.

What do you think, a stack of enchanting bottles for your trouble?  \n  &5[This book the bandit had said insurance...]  \n  &6[Octavius] \n Hah, you're smarter than you look. Yes, there's something questionably legal here, but keep your mouth shut and don't tell the guards and there's an extra stack of bottles in it for you.

Glad to see you know which way the wind blows. I'll mention your name to an associate who occasionally needs someone with your... scruples. \n  &5[Your bribery won't work. I'm going to Captain Murano!]  \n  &6[Octavius] \n Alas. You had such promise, and threw it away for the possibility of praise and promotion.
