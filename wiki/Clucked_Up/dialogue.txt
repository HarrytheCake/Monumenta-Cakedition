  WorkInProgress|The coords for the chickens in grove, Dialogue branch choosing [Uh, okay. Where can I get one?], &r
 To the start the quest you must be "Afflicted by the Clucks".
 This is just having an item with the cosmetic Clucking. This can be achieved in one of two ways.
 The first is by killing certain chickens found in the Grove where you will receive an item with Clucking or getting the arrow
with Clucking from   Link   Voyage of Discovery Voyage_of_Discovery wikilink and not using it.
 The second is by either being splashed or splashing yourself with a Jar of Clucks.
 The potion can only be obtained by buying from another player or by completing the race unlocked by this quest.
