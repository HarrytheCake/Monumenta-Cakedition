I wish to rebuild that school, but I require some assistance. \n  Color|purple|[How can I help?]}} \n  Color|purple|[No thanks.]}} \n  Color|orange|[The Teacher]}} \n Let's start with some rather... hard-to-come-by materials. In Alnera, there is a blacksmith who is famous across the world as the only able to create creating Crystallized Iron. Likewise, in Frostgate, an expert artisan is the only known crafter of Wisperwood Stakes. I require you to fetch these for me- they are of the utmost importance to my task.  \n&o  1/2 - Search out a blacksmith in Alerna that can produce crystallized iron.

Mistport? Damn that Xeno, we had a deal- stay away from me and my iron mines and I'll prioritize his end-of-month requests. \n  Color|purple|[I'm not here with-]}} \n  Color|orange|[Blacksmith Ghalla]}} \n You know what, I don't have time to stress about this. Here, take some that was just made, and get out.  \n&o  2/2 - You also need to find an artisan in Frostgate who can provide wisperwood stakes.

No no no, listen, I don't want any trouble with pirates.

Ohoh no no, that's not what these are for. No, they will come in handy much later; but don't worry too much about that. \n  Color|purple|[You said they were essential for building the school.]}} \n  Color|orange|[The Teacher]}} \n No, I believe I said they were essential for my task. You see, there was a lesson to learn here. What did you notice about the two individuals you visited? \n  Color|purple|[They were the only ones who could produce these items.]}} \n  Color|orange|[The Teacher]}} \n Precisely. You see, things are different here in the Isles than the are in the Valley. What you experienced today were individuals who are masters in their trades. \n  Color|orange|[The Teacher]}} \n The line doesn't draw there though. No, far from it. There are people who take their skills even higher: Specialists, you might say. And this is the crown jewel of knowledge: getting one of them to share their experience with you. So, for your final task, go find one of these specialists. Do what it takes to learn about their skills, and return to me with the knowledge you gained.  \n&o  Go out into the world and find a specialization master, and then return to the Teacher with the knowledge you learn from them. \n Each   Link   class specialization Class_Specializations wikilink has its own quest.
