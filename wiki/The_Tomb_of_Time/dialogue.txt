   &6[Vargos]
 Hello again [Player]. We've had some time to make plans. We all agree, even Bhairavi. Meeting the Crimson King is worth the
risk. As long as you're still in.
  &5[I'm not yet.]
  &6[Vargos]
 Let me know if you change your mind. The Isles are at risk...
  &5[I am.]
  &6[Vargos]
 Then it's decided. We'll send an excavation team to the Silver Tower where you said the place collapsed when you found the
Silver Knight... Goodness, those words seem wild to say.     Color|teal|{...}
  &6[Bhairavi]
 I'm a bit worried, but we're committed. Another excavation, at last. I think we can help. Zarek? Pten? Why don’t you two
accompany [Player]? Pten oversaw our excavation of C'Zanil's tomb, and Zarek is a powerful mage in their own right who can
easily help carve debris.     Color|teal|{...}
  &6[Pten]
 I would be honored.     Color|teal|{...}
  &6[Zarek]
 I'm in, ma'am!
  &5[Alright, let's go see what we can dig up at the Silver Tower.]
&o  C: Travel to the collapsed cavern under the Silver Tower.

  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Oh, good. You're here. I wasn't sure if you'd wait for us.]
  &6[Zarek]
 Whoa! You're more human than I thought you'd be!
  &5[Hey, that's rude!]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &6[Zarek]
 Amazing. Why have you been keeping them from us, [Player]?
  &5[I've not been, really. There's just been a lot going on.]
  &6[Pten]
 Let's get moving. This situation makes me quite uncomfortable...
  &5[Yes, let's. The Knight was up ahead.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
&o  C: Continue deeper into the cavern.
 After entering the deeper section:
&o  C: Discuss the scene with your allies. Table
 Zarek (Deeper cavern / ex-Lime Wool room)
  &6[Zarek]
 Uh, mates... This doesn't look good at all...
  &5[What did Teal do?!]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Do what you must.]
  &6[Pten]
 This is horrifying. Such damage in such a beautifully different area. This place looks nothing like the Chillwind I recognize.
Truly a much older work. Sorry, the archaeologist in me is coming out...
  &5[I'm not sure who built it, just that it housed the Lime Wool for a time before Salazar claimed it.]
  &6[Pten]
 From the limited encounter, this place seems populated by scavengers who claimed artifacts of these Silver Knights. I wonder if
they knew what they had.     Color|teal|{...}
  &6[Zarek]
 Somehow, I doubt it.
  &5[You guys are free to come back once this is all over.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Are you not coming?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[What do we need to know?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &5[Thank you.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  &6[Pten]
 Should we go back to Vargos and Bhairavi, or should we send word and head to this temple?
  &5[No. We need to find this temple. Can you reach them from here?]
  &6[Zarek]
 Absolutely. I’ll give them a buzz. Let’s get going.
&o  C: Leave the cavern.

 We should. Worst case, we conjure some in.
  &5[You can do that?]
  &6[Zarek]
 Gosh, I hope I can. I've done it before!
  &5[Alright then, let's see what we can find.]
  &6[Pten]
 Ready to go?
  &5[Nope.]

 That's the most walking I've had to do in years...
  &5[How long was that?]
  &6[Pten]
 I think we've been at this for half a day at least. I'm not sure how far we've gone, but I'm really exhausted... Should we head
through that doorway across the bridge and then set up some camp?
  &5[Sure. I wanna poke around before we do too much else though. That statue seems interesting...]
  &6[Pten]
 Be careful. We have no idea what kind of defenses the Isharistians would have established. Even if most of their territory has
been long-destroyed, something could still be active.  Table

 I think we're going to have to fight... I think it has a shield around itself though?
  &5[How do I break it?]
  &6[Zarek]
 I can read the electricity this thing is building up. I don't think you can hurt it directly, but it'll give off energy for
sure. Maybe you can take advantage there?
  &5[Give me a few to prepare.]
  &6[Zarek]
 You got it, boss.
  &5[I'm ready to try.]
  &6[Zarek]
 Let's send you in there!
  To defeat the boss you must kill 6(?) spark elementals (Floating seeded amethyst blocks with 90 hp each). LineBreak  The spark
elementals will randomly spawn. LineBreak  The boss will constantly be outputting netherite blocks foot level that deal large
amount of damage. The pattern changes from spiral to random.

 The Crimson King ( Link   Silver Knight's Tomb Silver_Knight's_Tomb wikilink Story mode)
  &6[The Crimson King]
  I can sense Time itself being distorted here. Not all of this place is from this time. Rifts are opening... Explore what lies
before us and find the Rifts, [Player]. It might be our only way forward.
  Rift The Lyrata: 90 207 333
 Rift Timetorn Legionary: 105 237 457
 Rift Infernal Flame: 19 246 398
 Rift Timesick Duo: 100 275 296
  After beating first rift:
  The time rift fades away as you land the finishing blow, and you find yourself back where you were.
  &6[The Crimson King]
  These beings have been ripped out of time... With them though, comes memories. Teal was here, exploring the past to find a way
through to the Knight hiding deeper within. There was a guardian, called the Silver Construct. Teal destroyed it and scattered
its pieces through these rifts to stop anyone following him into... whatever is next? Perhaps if we can find and close all of
the Rifts, we can restore the Guardian and use it?
 After beating second rift:
  The time rift fades away as you land the finishing blow, and you find yourself back where you were.
  &6[The Crimson King]
  Another piece of the Silver Construct! I can feel it reforming in the present. I am not sure what it will do once we have
completed it, but I can feel its power beginning to collect in the cathedral on the hill to the north. I can see a powerful
memory of the mighty Knights of Lyrata attempting desperately to hold it off as other mighty heroes stood firm, prepared to turn
it away. A duo of warriors, a master of forges, and something stranger still. Incredible.
 After beating third rift:
  The time rift fades away as you land the finishing blow, and you find yourself back where you were.
  &6[The Crimson King]
  Another rift, another part of the Construct. These guardians seem to be vital recollections of the elements of the Construct
itself, each involved in its eventual destruction. We are getting closer to completing our task. I sense the place beyond the
cathedral but I'm struggling to understand its purpose... The Forge?
 After beating fourth rift:
  The time rift fades away as you land the finishing blow, and you find yourself back where you were.
  A loud rumbling emanates from the Cathedral, echoing through the city as the final time rift collapses.
  &6[The Crimson King]
  Yes. The Forge. The Knights made... they made wool there. This is why I have been sent here, is it not? It is not just to help
you capture Teal... It is to remake my Home. I understand now. I have found the last piece of the Construct as you battled, but
something is strange. I tried to pull all of the memories together, much like I did the Monument in the Isles, but it did not
work. My power is not working well here. ange. But the Construct still arrived. It has been waiting to be reforged... I do not
think it will let us pass peacefully.

  We are here, at last, in the Forge of the Silver Knights. Let us enter the heart of these flames and craft a blank wool, like
the Knights have done so many times before. If not at this Forge, then at another they have created.
  &5[So the Silver Knights make the wool themselves?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  In a way. Whenever a wool was needed, they would craft the prison, specialized for the being they sought to contain, but I do
not know from what. We will need a specialized one to contain the Malefactor too. There will be guardians though. If we can
defeat them, I can take from them the memories they hold and we can craft the wool ourselves. Together.
  &5[Together. Should we craft a second wool for you?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  Home is... so... close. But no. Not yet. We have to handle Teal first. You really held up your end of the contract, [Player],
and I cannot thank you enough for it.
 Defeat the mini bosses that spawn (Dialogue when mini boss spawns):

  &6[The Crimson King]
  It is done. Together we have crafted a new wool. It is blank now. Soon we shall grant it a color. It is time to enter the
crypt itself, where the Silver Knight lies. Where the Malefactor himself waits for us. I need you to know I will not be of much
help in this coming fight, however.
  &5[Why? What happened?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  The power it took to craft this wool and make manifest the knowledge to do so has left me drained. Something about this place
has dampened my power significantly. Hopefully the same is true for Teal.
  &5[I hope so.]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  If this is the end of our time together, our last peaceful moment, I thank you for all you have done. This has been something
I will keep in my memory forever.
  &5[Thank you. You’ve, surprisingly, been a true ally. Let’s finish this, Vaessini. Let’s get you Home.]

  so you chose to follow. no matter. i will lay waste to you here as well. this place is so curious, is it not? the thunderous
power of the fall of an empire, leaving just this tiny slice, still humming with the energy of a million deaths. all to find us…
you and i, vaessini.
  &6[The Malefactor]
  i ask one last time. will you join with me? free our brethren? hunt down the remnants of the knights and their architect and
grant us the freedoms as gods, as we so rightly deserve?
  &6[The Crimson King]
  No. We are here to put you away again, where you belong.
  &6[The Malefactor]
  you cannot, fool. there is nothing left here. no knights to build you your prisons. i have damaged them. i have destroyed
them. we both know no knight would willingly follow one of us.
  &6[The Crimson King]
  Yet their memories remain. No Knight built this wool. I did.
  &6[The Malefactor]
  then i wish you luck trying. you can never stop me. it is far too late.
 Dialogue at start of fight:
  the full wrath of time itself will be upon you!
 Dialogue at 50% health:

 After defeating the Teal Spirit:
  &6[The Crimson King]
  This is it, the final time rift. At its end, you will surely find the very core of Orasomn's being. If you can manage to
collect it, our time here will draw to an end.

  I offer you the blank wool. Take it. Use it.
  &5[Right...]
  &6[Orasomn Core]
  you cannot... no. all i have worked for. all i have done for freedom. you are not strong enough to contain me!
  &5[You've threatened the safety of the entire world. There is no place for you here. It's time to go.]
  &6[Orasomn Core]
  i have the power of the entire empire at my control. i will not be contained for long. there is nothing you can do to keep me
locked away. your cheaply made wool is useless.
  &6[The Crimson King]
  But there is plenty I can do. I do not need to be within my own wool. My home is long-destroyed. But I can find solace here.
The jailed becomes the jailer. I will go within the wool as well, and keep Teal quelled. This is what has always been meant for
me, has it not? Teal and I have been forever entwined since the day the Knights captured him with my help. We shall thus be
entwined forever more within one wool of power. Do it. Now. Before it is too late.
  &5[Are you sure?]
  &6[The Crimson King]
  I have never been more sure of anything. Seal us away. The pedestal is nearby, I can feel it. Let me go home.
  &5[Very well, then. Goodbye, Vaessini.]

 The past is long buried by those who turn the world. It will always matter, but it will never turn back again. As the Veil

it all.
