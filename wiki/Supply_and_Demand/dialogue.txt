 Hello there, adventurer. I'm Buildmaster Jr., son of the esteemed Buildmaster, the buildmaster of Sierhaven. Would you be
willing to make a delivery for me? You'll be paid, obviously, when you return with the receipt proving the delivery was
successful!
  &5[I suppose.]
  &6[Buildmaster Jr.]
 Lovely! I need you to travel around this beautifully designed capital city of   Link   Sierhaven Sierhaven wikilink - no bias
of course - and gather a few items for me. There's been some recent bandit attacks around this area, and I'd like to send a
supply package to the neighboring town of   Link   Nyr Nyr wikilink  !
  &5[I'll do it!]
  &6[Buildmaster jr.]
 Excellent!
  &5[Maybe later.]
  &6[Buildmaster Jr.]
 You know where to find me!
  &5[Maybe later.]
  &6[Buildmaster Jr.]
 Ah, shame. Well, I'll be here if you change your mind. This delivery isn't gonna make itself!  Table

  &6[Buildmaster Jr.]
 So I've got a little shopping list here. We're going to need 32 glass blocks, 16 arrows, and 5 pieces of cooked chicken. Here's
some money to pay for it all, though feel free to keep it if you can gather the items yourself. Let me know when you've got it
all!
  &5[Where can I get glass?]
  &6[Buildmaster Jr.
 East, down the road, inside the workshop. The Block Suppliers sell it. If you check your quest compass, it should point there!
  &5[Where can I get arrows?]
  &6[Buildmaster Jr.
 Head west from the town square, then go into the third building on your right. Look for an arrow that is on display in a frame
outside. If you check check your quest compass, it should point there!
  &5[Where can I get cooked chicken?]
  &6[Buildmaster Jr.
 Head west from the town square, then take the second right. Take the right immediately after that and be on the lookout for
meat and leather. If you check your quest compass, it should point there!

&o  C [2/4]: Buy some arrows from the   Link   Rangers Ranger_(NPC) wikilink  . Coords: [-854, 104, 30]

 Wonderful, that's all the items! Thank you. Now I just need to take a moment to pack it all together, then I can send you on
your way.
  &5[My way?]
  &6[Buildmaster Jr.
 Of course. I need your courier services as well to transport the package to   Link   Nyr Nyr wikilink  , a little town to the
East of   Link   Sierhaven Sierhaven wikilink  . It's quite nearby and you'll be well compensated, as I've mentioned before.
  &5[Alright then.]
  &6[Buildmaster Jr.
 Splendid, my friend. Here's your Supply Package. I need you to take it to my friend Pauline. She lives in a very bookish little
house near the Nyr docks. She says she loves being near the Nyr River! She'll take care of the rest and give you a receipt. Come
back to me when you're done!
&o  C: Bring the supplies to Pauline in   Link   Nyr Nyr wikilink  . Table

 Wait... Are those the supplies Buildmaster Jr. promised me?
  &5[They are.]
  &6[Pauline]
 Amazing! He really pulled through! Here's a signed receipt for him. I know how much he loves being official like that. If
you're going to head back to him now, I really suggest taking the     fast travel between here and the capital.
&o  C [1/2]: It's time to head back. Use the Teleporter Hub in Nyr to quick-travel back to Sierhaven!
&o  C [2/2]: Once back in Sierhaven, return the receipt to Buildmaster Jr. Table
