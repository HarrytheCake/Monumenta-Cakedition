 Well met, (Player). I hope you have had some time to recover from our last outing together. I know it has taken quite the toll
on me, personally.
  &5I'm doing fine, how are things with you?&r
  &5I still need some time to process it.&r
  &6[Torren]&r
 Your shock is understandable. While we may not have known Lyson on a deep level, he stood for something that we both can
believe in. I wish to one day return to that peace.

  &6[Torren]&r
 I wish I could say the same, but... things have been rather rough lately.
  &5Rough how?&r
  &6[Torren]&r
 I suppose I should start by asking this: I've been given word that you were recently in Molta, conspiring with a foreman
against Amarion to open a sealed off mineshaft. This is correct, no?
  &5Yes, that is true.&r
  &6[Torren]&r
 Then, you have some familiarity with the suspicious behavior surrounding the government and this "Cursestone" that they were
seeking?
  &5We found an old log mentioning it, but nothing on why the government wanted it.&r
  &6[Torren]&r
 That is unfortunate, because the reason it has been rough recently, as I mentioned, is that the government has once against
begun their mining exploits in Molta. I believe they are once again seeking out this "Cursestone".
  &5That can't be good.&r
  &6[Torren]&r
 Quite. It began a few days after Lyson's death - dramatic timing, if I do say so. I figured there was not much I could do,
until I was reached out to by someone on the inside. That very man you worked with before, Foreman Boris. Unfortunately, I'm
stuck here under orders, unable to leave. Would you be willing to return to Molta and investigate?
  &5Yes, I'll go.&r
  &5I'm a bit busy right now.&r
  &6[Torren]&r
 That is unfortunate, but I understand. Please return if you feel you are up for the task.
  &6[Torren]&r
 Wonderful. Please make your way to Molta and seek out Boris with haste.
&o  Foreman Boris has been in contact with Torren. Seek him out in Molta.

   &6[Foreman Boris]&r
 Welcome to Mol- oh... (Player)... you're actually here...
  &5Whats the matter, Boris?&r
  &6[Foreman Boris]&r
 I... please don't be mad at me, (Player)... They threatened my family... Said they would do unspeakable things if I didn't lure
you here...
  &5What are you talking about...?&r
  &6[Alnera Guard]&r
 Don't move, (Player)! We have you surrounded!
&o  Whelp... You got arrested. Guess you're on your own.
  In order to escape the mineshaft, the following steps is required to get a key: OrderedList DefaultStyle DefaultDelim Plain
Obtain around 4-5 Old Pickaxes from Sani and have them be stolen by Leeton. After the event with him, give the crystal obtained
to Crispy Cal. He will then give you a minecart. Plain  Talk to the Wall Boy and believe him to get a small container. Then
agree with Tiq, Tiq then Toq and right click with the Small Container to put the endermites in the container. Plain  Once you
have both the container with endermites & a minecart, ask Sani to send the package up. Run up to where the guards are and pick
up the key they will drop after the event. Plain  Head to the Cyan Wool lobby button and speak to Boris.
 &o  You managed to escape the mine! Might as well talk to Boris while you're in the Cyan lobby.

   &6[Foreman Boris]&r
 Oh (Player)! Did you actually manage to escape?
  &5Yes I did, no thanks to you.&r
  &6[Foreman Boris]&r
 I'm so sorry, (Player)... I had no choice in the matter... The guards came to me before your arrival and threatened to go after
my family. Surely you can understand my predicament...
  &5Regardless Boris, you were Torren's contact.&r
  &6[Foreman Boris]&r
 Yes, that is correct. I made a connection to Torren out of concern of Alnera's recent actions. They have been forcing our labor
back into the mines to begin digging up Cursestone again.
  &5As much as I'd love to talk this over, I need to get out of here before the guards come looking for me.&r
  &6[Foreman Boris]&r
 That would be a good idea, and I'm sure your partners in Mistport would be interested in this, Vargos I believe was a name
Torren mentioned to me.
&o  Report what's happened to Vargos in Mistport.
 Vargos
  Coordinates: [-430, 83, 1337]
   &6[Vargos]&r
 Ah, (Player)! Torren was just in contact with us, something about you being captured by guards in Molta. We were planning some
means of escape for you, but I should have known you'd find your own way back.
  &5They certainly did not want me snooping around the mines.&r
  &6[Vargos]&r
 Yes well, whatever their goals are in Molta, I'm certain it has to do with Calder's envoy in the Ishnir government. They aren't
sparing any time now that Lyson is out of the way.
  &5What do you think we should do from here?&r
  &6[Vargos]&r
 The most reasonable action at this point is to use the knowledge available to us to try to deduce who the culprit is.
  &5So... we know that they have a high standing within the government...&r
  &6[Vargos]&r
 They also likely have a history of corruption...
  &5And they have the ability to direct guards to do their bidding...&r
  &6[Izzy]&r
 (Player)! That's it! That head guard in Alnera who assisted Xeno in the killing of Vargos' assistant. He fits all those
criteria!
  &5Who? I don't really remember...&r
  &5Obadiah? Yeah I guess I do remember him...&r
  &6[Vargos]&r
 That's an astute observation, Izzy, and it's as good of a lead as we're going to get at this point.
  &5So how do we act on it? I can't exactly go barging into Alnera right now.&r
  &6[Vargos]&r
 You're right, you probably can't get noticed in Alnera right now... However, we might be able to use Torren to lure Obadiah to
Rahkeri, where you can intercept him.
  &5Sounds like as good of a plan as any.&r
  &6[Vargos]&r
 Then we'll do it. I'll make contact with Torren, you start making your way to his home in Rahkeri.
&o  Return to Torren in Rahkeri.

   &6[Torren]&r
 Yes I have, and he filled me in on your plan. Likewise, I sent the emergency request to Alnera for Obadiah's visit. I expect
them to enter the town through the transporters at any point now.
  &5Thank you for helping us, Torren.&r
  &6[Torren]&r
 Of course, I... Wait, what's going on?
  &6[Mysterious Voice]&r
 Oh come on, Torren. You didn't think I'd fall for your summons, did you? We've known you were working with this traitor for a
while now, but thank you for giving us the proof needed to arrest you.
  &5You feel some power grab on to you and get teleported away.&r
&o  Arrested again... Why does this keep happening?
 Head Guard Obadiah
  Coordinates: [-1531, 106, -1328]
   &6[Head Guard Obadiah]&r
 Keep away from the gate, prisoner.
  &5Don't think I don't know what you're up to, Obadiah.&r
  &6[Head Guard Obadiah]&r
 What I'm up to? I have no idea what you're talking about. Regardless, you've got a scheduled appearance in the pharaoh's throne
room, and you're being held here until then.
  &5What does she want with me?&r
  &6[Head Guard Obadiah]&r
 I don't disclose matters that aren't my business. Just let me know when you're ready to go, and I'll escort you there.
  &5I'm ready to go.&r
  &6[Head Guard Obadiah]&r
 Very well...
  &5I'm not ready.&r
  &6[Head Guard Obadiah]&r
 Then get away from the gate!

   &6[Torren]&r
 I don't believe it... I've never heard of all three pharaohs gathering to speak to a prisoner...
  &5Why are we even here? And since when have there been three?&r
  &6[Pharaoh Nasha Ka]&r
 Captain of Mistport! I didn't expect to see you in this hall again so soon.
  &5Yeah, I wasn't too thrilled about it either.&r
  &6[Pharaoh Tyro Syl]&r
 Let's not catch the attitude so quickly. We would not have all gathered here if we did not wish to talk civilly with you.
  &5Talk about what? Why you arrested me and threw me in a mineshaft?&r
  &6[Pharaoh Kamen Den]&r
 While that may seem cruel, we needed a way to hold you until we could transport you here. Not that it worked... But the matter
we wish to discuss is the man you brought from Wispervale, Lyson.
  &5What about him?&r
  &6[Pharaoh Nasha Ka]&r
 As I am the one who met Lyson, I can speak for his character. What we wish to know is... Why did you bring him here to kill
him?
  &5Excuse me... what?&r
  &6[Pharaoh Kamen Den]&r
 We have multiple credible witnesses that say after your meeting with Pharaoh Ka, you lured Lyson behind the palace and
assassinated him.
  &5ME?!?! Lyson was killed by your guards!&r
  &6[Pharaoh Tyro Syl]&r
 That's quite the bold claim, but one I doubt you have proof over. Obadiah, can you corroborate this?
  &6[Obadiah]&r
 No such thing occurred, your highness. My guards would never commit such a heinous act.
  &5Obadiah, you traitorous--&r
  &6[Pharaoh Tyro Syl]&r
 Alright, I've had enough of you, (Player). Clearly you are not interested in having a conversation. We'll have the guards
interrogate your reasonings once you have some time to ponder in the palace cells. Torren, do you have anything to say for
yourself.
  &5Torren, you have to tell them what's going on here.&r
  &6[Torren]&r
 I... No, your majesty... Nothing that hasn't already been said.
  &6[Pharaoh Kamen Den]&r
 Obadiah, return these two to the prison cells.
 Head Guard Obadiah
  Coordinates: [-1531, 106, -1328]
   &6[Head Guard Obadiah]&r
 You know, I expected more from you, (Player). You were suppose to change Mistport for the better, remove Xeno's corruption from
this world, but turns out you're no better than him.
  &5[Don't give me that! I know you're the reason I'm in this mess!]&r
  &6[Head Guard Obadiah]&r
 What are you on about this time?
  &5[I know you're the one working for Calder.]&r
  &6[Head Guard Obadiah]&r
 And who might Calder be? I've never even heard that name before.
  &5[The one who told you to order your guards to attack me and kill Lyson.]&r
  &6[Head Guard Obadiah]&r
 You're full of it. I never ordered my guards to do such a thing, and the only people besides myself who could order such a
thing are the pharaohs.
  &5[Wait... what?]&r
  &6[Head Guard Obadiah]&r
 I am the head of the Alnera guard, there is no one above me in the chain of command than the pharaohs themselves. As such, they
are the only ones able to mobilize troops.
  &5[A pharaoh... Wait, which of the pharaohs has control of Molta? Who would be interested in the mining operations?]&r
  &6[Head Guard Obadiah]&r
 Head of Molta? Well, Pharaoh Nasha Ka is the "Pharaoh of the Northern Sands", so technically speaking, she is in charge of the
overseeing of that region of Ishnir.
  &5[And she's the one that met with me and Lyson!]&r
  &6[Head Guard Obadiah]&r
 What.... what are you getting at, (Player)?
  &5[I'm saying I had it wrong. Calder's agent isn't you, it's the pharaoh!]&r
  &6[Head Guard Obadiah]&r
 How am I suppose to respond to that? I can't just let you go attack the pharaoh. Letting you out of this cell would be enough
to get me fired.
  &5[Obadiah please, this whole country will go to war if you don't let me go.]&r
  &6[Head Guard Obadiah]&r
 No, I'm not going to have anything to do with this. I'm staying here and keeping my post.
  &5Obadiah looks away and "accidentally" opens the bars long enough for you to walk out.&r
    &6[Pharaoh Nasha Ka]&r
 I feel a presence in my chambers... Who dares to stumble through my belongings unannounced?
  &6[Pharaoh Nasha Ka]&r
 You... I should have known that buffoon of a guard wouldn't be able to keep you from escaping.
  &5[I know you're the one working with Calder.]&r
  &6[Pharaoh Nasha Ka]&r
 Yes, and what of it? I am a pharaoh. My actions are merely done for what is best for my people. You do not have the right to
stand against me.
  &5[How is starting a war beneficial to your people?!]&r
  &6[Pharaoh Nasha Ka]&r
 That man showed me a new path, one that will benefit the world for generations to come. But I have no need to answer your
questions, it's time I take care of you, once and for all.
 After defeating Pharaoh Nasha Ka:
  &6[Pharaoh Nasha Ka]&r
 I just... wanted to make a better world... but no matter... he already has what he needs...
&o  Wrap things up with Obadiah.

 The palace may be open to the public, but it's not a place for dilly-dallying. Keep moving.
  &5[I'm sorry for blaming you earlier, Obadiah...]&r
  &6[Head Guard Obadiah]&r
 Oh, (Player)! No worries, I'm glad everything turned out alright, but....
  &5[But what?]&r
  &6[Head Guard Obadiah]&r
 Pharaohs Tyro Syl and Kamen Den are requesting your appearance immediately. I... I can't promise I'm not going to have to
arrest you again...
  &5[It's fine, I'll see them and clear this up once and for all.]&r
  &6[Head Guard Obadiah]&r
 Very well, let's head in.
  &6[Pharaoh Tyro Syl]&r
 We meet yet again, (Player), though I wish it were on better terms.8.086
  &5[I assume you want to ask about my involvement with Nasha.]&r
  &6[Pharaoh Kamen Den]&r
 Correct. Considering the circumstances, we wish for you to fully explain in detail what occurred.
  Color|Cyan|You begin thoroughly explaining the pharaoh's involvement with Calder.&r
  &6[Pharaoh Kamen Den]&r
 An outsider who wanted to start a war... and Nasha was working with him in the shadows this whole time... (Player), I must ask,
do you know what their endgame in all this is? If a war was a means of distraction, what is the goal they were trying to cover
up?
  &5[Unfortunately, we've not yet figured that out.]&r
  &6[Pharaoh Tyro Syl]&r
 It sounds too horrifying to be true, that someone closest to us would betray us in this way... However, your eyes are obviously
unclouded, (Player), and we will strive to assist you in repairing our relations with the Chillwind. May you walk away from this
day knowing you have earned the gratitude of all of Ishnir.
