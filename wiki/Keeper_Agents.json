You will not regret assisting the Silver Codex. Now to business.  \n  &5[Let's get started.]  \n  &6[The High Priest] \n I have my eye on four citizens as of now. Each have been spotted in the area during the sabotage of the food stores, according to confessions of other citizens when I sent out a call. \n  &5[First, what happened to the food itself?] \n  &6[The High Priest] \n Oh, it is clearly malicious. There were strange mechanical orbs tossed into the food, leaking a viscous black liquid into the wheat. Now, the suspects. \n  &5[Indeed.] \n  &5[Wait, what? I'm sorry, I'm kinda busy right now...]  \n  &6[The High Priest] \n We don't have time for your excuses, hero. I have my eye on four citizens as of now.

First, what happened to the food itself?] \n  &6[The High Priest] \n Oh, it is clearly malicious.

To my understanding, she runs a stall selling fresh produce, I hear little of its success though. \n  Color|purple|[Where can I find Gorm?]}}  \n  Color|orange|[The High Priest]}} \n Gorm works day and night in the general market area. I trust the boy really, and admire his devotion, but we must be thorough with our sources. \n  Color|purple|[Where can I find Garmon?]}}  \n  Color|orange|[The High Priest]}} \n Garmon... I would hazard a guess he's by the front gates. His frailty concerns me, but we must investigate as necessary. \n  Color|purple|[Where can I find Cairn?]}}  \n  Color|orange|[The High Priest]}} \n Ah, the Doctor. Their office should be in a small building to the North-West. I deeply admire their work ethic, though they don't often come to pray...  \n&o  C: Investigate the saboteur of the food stores with the High Priest of New Antium.

Even if no one here will admit that we're forced to trade with our lowland \"partners\", the Dichen, a fact is still a fact, no matter how you look at it. Unified currency helps too, I suppose. \n  Color|purple|[Who are you ?]}}  \n  Color|orange|[Lanora]}} \n I'm Lanora and before you ask - no, I'm in no way related to that bartender gal in the tavern.

Let's see if you want to buy anything? \n  Color|purple|[Do you know anything about spoiled food in the supplies?]}} \n  Color|orange|[Lanora]}} \n Wha-what?! Is this some sort of accusation? Listen, I know my business isn't doing so well, but I - I would never stoop so low as to sabotage what remains of our city! I DO have standards. \n  Color|purple|[Why were you around the church so late at night then?]}} \n  Color|orange|[Lanora]}} \n Well, I had heard a loud noise so I went to investigate, I was concerned dear. I too rely on the general food storage, we can't live on just fruit and vegetables, no matter how fresh ours are! Nothing seemed out of the ordinary when I got there though. I suppose it was dark so I couldn't see much. \n  Color|purple|[Do you have any leads as to who might be then?]}} \n  Color|orange|[Lanora]}} \n I...Wouldn't say so... I mean... No...

Powerful Ashkii never betray Architect. Gorm despaired with lack of vision, but Architect's light saved Gorm. I have no vision still, but I trust in the Architect that my future will be bright. \n  Color|purple|[Why were you near the church so late then?]}} \n  Color|orange|[Gorm]}} \n Ashkii proud.
