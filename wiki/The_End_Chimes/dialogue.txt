 The man takes a large swig, then turns towards you.

 Its darrrk sails stalk the edddges of ocean, bringing a cooonstant ssstormmm in its wake. It was leddd by the MIGHTY Captain
Varrrcosa.
 He gestures dramatically as he speaks, mug sloshing in hand.
  &6[Drunken Sailor]&r
 They saaay the ship'sss bells can sti- *hic* still be h-heard, looking fffor their lost master... SoftBreak  The man has
clearly had too much to drink. He is hard to understand.
  &5[Hey, stay with me now. How could I find it?]&r

  &6[Drunken Sailor]&r
 *hic* But they were the lassst one to have a "pppristine" bell from the ship. So! I'm sure aaany dreams of finding the Blackkk
Mist lie at the b-bottom of the ssszzz...
 He finally drifts off as his head hits the table, toppling his mug.
