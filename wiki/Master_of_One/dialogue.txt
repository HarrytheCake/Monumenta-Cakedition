 The Teacher SoftBreak  Coordinates: -1829, 127, 2431
  &6[The Teacher]&r
 Well hello, you must be      &5[You have?]&r
  &6[The Teacher]&r
 Yes, it was only logical you would end up here eventually. I knew it would happen.
  &5[So why were you waiting for me?]&r
  &5[That's a tad creepy.]&r
  &6[The Teacher]&r
 You see, the building you passed through on your way here once housed a great school, one where people of all trades could come
and hone their skills to new heights. I wish to rebuild that school, but I require some assistance.
  &5[How can I help?]&r
  &5[No thanks.]&r
  &6[The Teacher]&r
 Let's start with some rather... hard-to-come-by materials. In Alnera, there is a blacksmith who is famous across the world as
the only able to create creating Crystallized Iron. Likewise, in Frostgate, an expert artisan is the only known crafter of
Wisperwood Stakes. I require you to fetch these for me- they are of the utmost importance to my task.
&7&o  1/2 - Search out a blacksmith in Alerna that can produce crystallized iron.
 Blacksmith Ghalla SoftBreak  Coordinates: 438, 61, 770
  &6[Blacksmith Ghalla]&r
 I don't really have much time to talk. Got a lot of orders to fill today.
  &5[I was sent to ask you about some Crystallized Iron.]&r
  &6[Blacksmith Ghalla]&r
 You and every other person in the world. Listen, if you want a weapon, you'll need to place an order like everyone else.
  &5[I don't want a weapon, I was just sent to get some iron for Mistport.]&r
  &6[Blacksmith Ghalla]&r
 WHAT? Mistport? Damn that Xeno, we had a deal- stay away from me and my iron mines and I'll prioritize his end-of-month
requests.
  &5[I'm not here with-]&r
  &6[Blacksmith Ghalla]&r
 You know what, I don't have time to stress about this. Here, take some that was just made, and get out.
&7&o  2/2 - You also need to find an artisan in Frostgate who can provide wisperwood stakes.
 Artisan Angra SoftBreak  Coordinates: -1500, 98, 938
  &6[Artisan Angra]&r
 Hello there, are you looking for anything specific today? Some crafted displays, or maybe a polished table?
  &5[I think I'm good right now.]&r
  &5[I was sent to ask you about a Wisperwood Stake.]&r
  &6[Artisan Angra]&r
 Oh my, I haven't made one of those in years. That trade started dying when the wood became endangered. I'm the only one left
that can even still make them, though I won't hurt that species any more than I already have.
  &5[I need one for a mission I have in Mistport.]&r
  &6[Artisan Angra]&r
 Mistport?! No no no, listen, I don't want any trouble with pirates. I moved to Frostgate to get away from them.
  &5[I'm not going to hurt-]&r
  &6[Artisan Angra]&r
 Here look, I have a single one still in my drawer that I keep to remember the old days. You can take it, but please just leave.
&7&o  Return to The Teacher when you have both the crystallized iron and whisperwood stake.
 The Teacher SoftBreak  Coordinates: -1829, 127, 2431
  &6[The Teacher]&r
 Ahh yes, both of these are perfect. They will do just nicely.
  &8The Teacher slides both items into his drawer.&r
  &5[How do these things help us with the rebuilding the school?]&r
  &6[The Teacher]&r
 These? Ohoh no no, that's not what these are for. No, they will come in handy much later; but don't worry too much about that.
  &5[You said they were essential for building the school.]&r
  &6[The Teacher]&r
 No, I believe I said they were essential for my task. You see, there was a lesson to learn here. What did you notice about the
two individuals you visited?
  &5[They were the only ones who could produce these items.]&r
  &6[The Teacher]&r
 Precisely. You see, things are different here in the Isles than the are in the Valley. What you experienced today were
individuals who are masters in their trades.
  &6[The Teacher]&r
 The line doesn't draw there though. No, far from it. There are people who take their skills even higher: Specialists, you might
say. And this is the crown jewel of knowledge: getting one of them to share their experience with you. So, for your final task,
go find one of these specialists. Do what it takes to learn about their skills, and return to me with the knowledge you gained.
&7&o  Go out into the world and find a specialization master, and then return to the Teacher with the knowledge you learn from
them.
 Each   Link   class specialization Class_Specializations wikilink has its own quest. Complete the oneÂ of your choosing and
return to The Teacher.

&7&o  You should probably head back to the Teacher in Mistport to tell him of the knowledge you've learned here.
 The Teacher SoftBreak  Coordinates: -1829, 127, 2431
  &5[The Teacher]&r
 Ahh, I sense you are much wiser than the last time we spoke! You found a master, didn't you? Please, tell me about your time
with them.
  &8You tell the teacher about your adventure.&r
  &5[The Teacher]&r
 I see! How fascinating; I would never have even considered that! Very well, I shall do what needs to be done to remake that
building into the great school it once was. That said, your assistance is still needed. I sense that there are still many more
masters out there in the world. Search them out and continue to learn what they teach. From that, we may further expand our data
bank of knowledge.
