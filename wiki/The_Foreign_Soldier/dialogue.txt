 Ah, hello again      Color|purple|[Have you found more information on Calder?]
  Color|purple|[I'm sorry about your apprentice.]
  Color|orange|[Vargos]
 Unfortunately no. We have a few leads, but nothing conclusive yet. However, we do still need you for something in the meantime.
  Color|purple|[What is it?]
  Color|orange|[Izzy]
 Our reports suggest that both Ishnir and Chillwind royals have gotten word of the exchange of power here in Mistport. That is
to say, they've likely got their eyes on you.
  Color|purple|[That seems bad.]
  Color|orange|[Izzy]
 Not quite. We could use this as a good opportunity to understand a bit more about the war. Given how much we have to watch our
actions due to the conflicts between the nations, we still understand suprisingly little about what those conflicts are over.
It's a tense situation, and the smallest action from either side could lead to actual bloodshed.
  Color|purple|[So you want me to investigate the war?]
  Color|orange|[Vargos]
 Indeed. We need you get close with some of the more influential citizens of the Isles, those who likely hold information not
publicly known. How does that sound to you?
  Color|purple|[I'll do it.]
  Color|purple|[Not right now.]
  Color|orange|[Vargos]
 Fantastic! I've had our sources compile a list of people who might be the best targets. Seek them out, and see what information
you can extract from them.
&o  Seek out the people Vargos has suggested you find. Header general_arne  General Arne Table

 Good day! The firing range is quite nice today!
  Color|purple|[The firing range? You're aiming at the ocean!]
  Color|orange|[General Arne]
 That we are! Can't do much damage to the surrounding areas if we fire out into the ocean, now can we?
  Color|purple|[I guess I can't argue with that.]
  Color|orange|[General Arne]
 Say, are you busy right now? You seem like you know your way around a complicated firing mechanism. We are down a man today and
could really use some help with setup.
  Color|purple|[What do you need me to do?]
  Color|orange|[General Arne]
 Well, the trebuchet's mechanisms have gone a bit crazy today and need a manual reset. Unfortunately, I can't reset it myself,
as someone needs to stand up here and check all the moving parts as they are manually adjusted. So, if you could go down into
the panel room and fix the situation, I would highly appreciate your services.
  Color|purple|[I think I can manage that.]
&o  Head down to the control room below the catapult. Table
 General Arne
  Color|orange|[General Arne]
 Ah, lovely! Everything is working smoothly now! This will be perfect for our tests!
  Color|purple|[Why do you need to test a trebuchet?]
  Color|orange|[General Arne]
 What a silly question, to make sure it works obviously! However, there is a second reason. You seem trustworthy enough, so I'll
let you in on something. Recently, the government has developed a new weapon, similar to a trebuchet, but moveable on land, ice,
sand, anything! It will be a fantastic asset in the war. We test this trebuchet for experimental data for this new weapon.
  Color|purple|[Seems powerful.]
  Color|orange|[General Arne]
 Quite! With this at our disposal, Alnera better watch their backs. Their era of slavery won't last much longer.
  Color|purple|[Slavery?]
  Color|orange|[General Arne]
 You've not heard of it? I guess you don't really seem like you're from around here, so let me explain. One of the reasons we
conflict with Ishnir is the government's abuse towards their people.
  Color|orange|[General Arne]
 The royals and bureaucrats of Alnera live in luxury, while their lower class, who have been shipped off to Molta, slave day
after day in ceaseless mining operations. No rights, no pay. They are slaves to the system, and we strive for a world in which
they are free.

 Hmm... Aren't these fungal specimens great?
  Color|purple|[Why are you keeping mushrooms in your house?]
  Color|orange|[Kugo]
 Why, I study them, of course. Unfortunately, I can't keep all my specimens here- not enough space. I have to use a storage unit
I own just down the way to house them all.
  Color|purple|[What do you research them for?]
  Color|orange|[Kugo]
 Haha! I couldn’t possibly say! Interests in taking over the world, maybe? Who knows!
  Color|purple|[Not the answer I was expecting.]
  Color|orange|[Kugo]
 Hah, I merely jest! I’m a scientist, I study things because they need to be studied. I merely wish I could increase my specimen
samples a bit more, ah, the dreams!
  Color|purple|[Increase how?]
  Color|orange|[Kugo]
 You see, I have a large array of knowledge of fungal species from Ishnir, and even some from the Viridian region. However, the
ones that elude me come from the Chillwind. I hear stories of a large fungal forest that exists there, crystalline mushrooms of
enormous size! Ah, how I wish I could get a sample of it. Alas, I'm much too busy with my current studies to make time to travel
there.
  Color|purple|[I could probably get a sample for you.]
  Color|orange|[Kugo]
 Really?! That would be fantastic! Thank you so much! I hear of such wonders in the Crystal Forest Grove, I can't wait to see
what you return with!
&o  Head towards the Crystal Forest Grove for a fungal sample. Table

  Color|orange|[Kugo]
 It's... it's beautiful! Look at the mycelium threads! Is this really a fungus? How fascinating, I can't... I can't...
  Color|gray|Kugo begins to cry a little.
  Color|purple|[What's the matter?]
  Color|orange|[Kugo]
 I... I may have lied to you a little. I'm not just a researcher... Specifically, I am a researcher for the government. They...
they took an interest in my knowledge of fungal species, and wanted me to determine a way to destroy the crystalline shroom
forest in Chillwind...
  Color|purple|[Why would they want that?]
  Color|orange|[Kugo]
 I... I don't know. The war ravages all, I suppose. But... after seeing this specimen, I... I can't let that happen. A species
such as this, where its very being is intertwined with crystalline essence, is incredibly rare. I refuse to let them destroy
such a thing.

  Color|purple|[I'm sorry, I didn't realize.]
  Color|purple|[What are you an ambassador to?]
  Color|orange|[Ambassador Matori]
 I don't mean to be rude, but if I just let anyone walk in, my throat would have been slit years ago. Besides, I'm quite on edge
right now, so startling me is not the best idea. I've got a lot on my plate.
  Color|purple|[What has you on edge?]
  Color|orange|[Ambassador Matori]
 Just... the war, I suppose. It makes my job as the Ambassador of Chillwind a... rough position, to say the least. All of my
days are spent hearing constant yelling, and battle strategies, and equally horrid plans of action. I... guess I just long for
days of peace.
  Color|purple|[Is there anything I can do to help?]
  Color|orange|[Ambassador Matori]
 Ha! Can you solve hundreds of years of political turmoil in a day? That'd be swell. That said, I would love a nice cup of tea.
Not just any tea, Royal Red tea, some of the most delicious tea in all of Ishnir. An old hag in Rahkeri named Surya sells the
leaves, and I would very much appreciate you bringing some here so I can brew some.
  Color|purple|[I think I can handle that.]

 Ah, fantastic! They smell wonderful! I'll get the pot going now. You don't know how much this helps me. My thoughts can finally
clear up from...
  Color|purple|[From?]
  Color|orange|[Ambassador Matori]
 Well, I was just thinking about Wispervale, one of the more contentious points of our conflicts with the Chillwind. It comes up
quite a bit in war strategy meetings. You see, one of the reasons we conflict so heavily with the Chillwind due to their
obsessive hatred against the use of magic. They hunt down magic users like dogs, and have even subjected some to public
executions.
  Color|orange|[Ambassador Matori]
 The people of Ishnir simply wish for a world where magic can freely be used by everyone, and Wispervale is an outpost for such
ideals, stationed right in the heart of the Chillwind. They are subjugated for their use of magic, but one day, they will be
free.
  Color|purple|[Why does-]

 Ooo! Seems my tea is ready! Again, thank you so much!

 Ah,      Color|purple|[Yes, but it's not simple to explain.]
  Color|orange|[Vargos]
 Oh? Do tell.
  Color|purple|[It seems the two nations don't really agree on why they are fighting.]
  Color|orange|[Vargos]
 Hmm... conflicting reasons? How odd. I won't pretend I understand the political turmoil here, but there must be a common
underlying reason that the conflicts restarted recently. If I had to make a guess...
  Color|orange|[Izzy]
 I hate to interrupt here, but I've just gotten word that we have some visitors on the island.
  Color|purple|[Visitors?]
  Color|orange|[Izzy]
 It seems our hunch was correct, the royals of the nations did have their eyes on you, and they've each sent an emissary to
speak with the new captain of Mistport.
  Color|purple|[What should we do?]
  Color|orange|[Vargos]
 Well      Color|purple|[Why would we do that?]
  Color|orange|[Vargos]
 Think about it, our connections in the Isles are sparse, and we can only accomplish so much. If we allied ourselves with one of
the nations, this would give us access to their vast information network. We'd be able to track Calder down much more
efficiently.
  Color|purple|[I guess you're right.]
  Color|orange|[Vargos]
 I'll leave the decision of which nation we should ally with up to you, this is your island afterall. Choose wisely though, once
you have made a decision, I doubt the other side will be very forgiving.
  Color|orange|[Izzy]
 You'll find the emissaries near Xeno's old ship. They are stationed out on the docks there.
  Color|red|Make your decision carefully before speaking to the emissary of your choice, as it might affect future outcomes.

 Ah, straight to the point, I see. Well, it's no secret that Xeno didn't quite make a good relation with any kingdom. He sought
power and wealth and would knock anyone down who got in his way. We simply wish to extend our hand in partnership with your town
of pirates. We don't wish to rule you or anything of the sort, only that we agree aide each other when necessary, and don't get
in each other's way against our enemies.

 Of course. You must be someone who chooses wisely in their allies, to defeat Xeno and even take over his rule. No such feat

 Very well. It should be clear enough to you that Xeno was not the type of person who would have had many allies. He was unable
to resist the temptation of wealth and power. We only wish to make an ally here today, a partnership with the new Captain of
Mistport. It would be mutually beneficial for our two kingdoms to work together. Perhaps we even share common enemies.
