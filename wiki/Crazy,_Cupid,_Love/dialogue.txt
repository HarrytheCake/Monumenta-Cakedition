&o  Decipher the contents. LineBreak  Solution:     Spoiler|''
The book name hints at an encryption which shifts letters around. Ventus hints that the encryption requires a key. Together,
this hints at the Vigen√®re Cipher.<br>
Decrypting the book with this cipher and the key "Eros" results in the text "Baneofthebakers Mageslegacy Acrewtoremember

These are all Monumenta Quests. Ventus hints at "Where they began", which indicates the quest givers. These are: Stefan, Vargos,
Indigo, Levyn, Leonard, Aimee, Gehri, and Eowen".<br>
The first letters of their names read "SVILLAGE", which hints to the Southern Village POI.
