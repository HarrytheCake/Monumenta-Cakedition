you. I hope my Cupid returns to me, I miss him so... LineBreak   &6[Psychie]&r Say, do you know anything about these strange
signs that have appeared above my bower's windows? I can't work them out...

&7&o  Decipher the contents. LineBreak  Solution:     Spoiler|''
The book name hints at an encryption which shifts letters around. Ventus hints that the encryption requires a key. Together,
this hints at the Vigen√®re Cipher.<br>
Decrypting the book with this cipher and the key "Eros" results in the text "Baneofthebakers Mageslegacy Acrewtoremember
Apirateslife Runawaypet Crownoftopaz Whatlieswithin Lostinmymind".<br>
These are all Monumenta Quests. Ventus hints at "Where they began", which indicates the quest givers. These are: Stefan, Vargos,
Indigo, Levyn, Leonard, Aimee, Gehri, and Eowen".<br>
The first letters of their names read "SVILLAGE", which hints to the Southern Village POI.
