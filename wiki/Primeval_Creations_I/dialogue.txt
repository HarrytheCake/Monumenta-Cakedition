 I don't really have much time to talk. Got a lot of orders to fill today.
  &5[I found this book that mentions your name.]

 Where did you find that? Actually, it doesn't matter, just leave it on the counter so it doesn't get lost.
  &5[Do you know who it belongs to?]
  &6[Blacksmith Ghalla]
 Of course I do, it belongs to Selari. Can't you see his name etched on the spine? Anyway, he's not here right now. He left
about a week ago, saying something about his research notes getting stolen. No clue when he will be back.
