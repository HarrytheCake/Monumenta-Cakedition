 C:   &o  You found an old journal in the Alnera Archives. See if you can follow up on it. You can always find it there again if
you lose it.

 I don't really have much time to talk. Got a lot of orders to fill today.
  &5[I found this book that mentions your name.]&r
  &6[Blacksmith Ghalla]&r
 Where did you find that? Actually, it doesn't matter, just leave it on the counter so it doesn't get lost.
  &5[Do you know who it belongs to?]&r
  &6[Blacksmith Ghalla]&r
 Of course I do, it belongs to Selari. Can't you see his name etched on the spine? Anyway, he's not here right now. He left
about a week ago, saying something about his research notes getting stolen. No clue when he will be back.
  &8Little did I understand how hard it was to infuse an object with an aspect of power. The artifacts must be much more than
simple sheep fur, and from that revelation, I began to invent.&r
  &3ESSENCE OF THE UNIVERSE&r
  &8In order to gather that much energy into a single point, a pure tesseract is needed to hold the energy in place, one formed
from the perfect alignment of all aspects of their power. When all 6 intersections of the three rings match, the power generated
will be enough to collapse a small gem into the necessary crystalline structure.&r
 After you complete the tesseract puzzle:
  &8With the tesseract complete, I was able to move on and further my work. Now that an object existed that was totally untuned
from all aspects of the universe, with enough pushing, it can be convinced that it aligns with a single aspect of primeval
power.&r
&o  The floor falls out from below you, and you make your way through a small passageway until you find a narrow hallway.
  &3THE POWER OF SOUL&r
  &8Of everything I have researched, the power of Soul might be the most strange. For what is a soul? Is it defined? Is it a
constant? This machine attempts to answer that, and reaches deep within your soul, shaping itself to your darkest fears - that
which you hoped you'd never see again, but far more painful than anything you remember. Remove all light from the soul in order
to harness its true power.&r
 After you complete the soul puzzle:
  &8The soul is definitely not constant, but it wishes for a state of stability. By harnessing that desire for stability, a soul
can be bound to something physical - a person, an object, a place. That is the true power of the Aspect of Soul. Alas, this
design was a failure, but I have learned greatly nonetheless. The power of Soul alone was not what I required, thus it was time
to progress onwards.&r
