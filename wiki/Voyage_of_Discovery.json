I've heard you've managed to complete the Monument behind Highwatch. That's absolutely brilliant!\n  &5[It was nothing, really.]\n  &5[Yes, it took a great deal of effort.]\n  &6[Captain Argoun]\n I could actually use your help, if you wouldn't mind.\n  &5[I still have things to attend to in the Valley.]\n  &6[Captain Argoun]\n Alright, well please come back when you get the chance.\n  &5[What is it?]\n  &6[Captain Argoun]\n Captain Indigo has been pushing to get a permit to leave the King's Valley, but we aren't too keen to give permission to\nsuch... unsavory characters. You've helped her out before, would you vouch for her permit?\n  &5[Pirates don't have rights.]\n  &6[Captain Argoun]\n That might be a bit exaggerated, but I get your point. I'm still not sure, so if you change your mind I'll be here.\n  &5[Captain Indigo is of no danger.]\n  &6[Captain Argoun]\n I was starting to lean that way as well. Alright, I'm convinced! You can go let Captain Indigo know she is all set to sail\nthrough the Seagate.\n&o  Tell Indigo she has been cleared to pass through the seagate. Table\n Captain Indigo\n  &6[Captain Indigo]\n Ahoy [Player]! We're all itching to set sail soon. Hopefully our permit will be approved soon.\n  &5[Good news! It's been approved.]\n  &6[Captain Indigo]\n That is amazing news! We're all ready to take off here, would you care to join us on our maiden voyage?\n  &5[Where are you sailing to?]\n  &6[Captain Indigo]\n We'll be headed to the haven of pirates, the   Link   Celsian Isles Celsian_Isles wikilink  . There, we'll find treasures\ngalore in the Viridian region!\n  &5[I think I prefer land for now.]\n  &6[Captain Indigo]\n Arrgh! Return quickly if you change your mind.\n  &5[Absolutely.]\n /     &5[Alright, I'm in.]\n  &6[Captain Indigo]\n Are you ready to set sail?\n  &5[Arrgh!]\n  &6[Captain Indigo]\n ARRGH!\n C:   &o  Talk to Captain Indigo. Table\n Captain Indigo\n  &6[Captain Indigo]\n Ahoy [Player]! The sea is beautiful today, don't you think so?\n  &5[I think I'm going to be sick.]\n  &6[Captain Indigo]\n Ha- after you're done hurling off the starboard you should check in with Izzy to see where we are.\n  &5[We should just stay on the sea forever.]\n  &6[Captain Indigo]\n Well, we'll need to reach port eventually, so why don't you go check with Izzy to see where we are.\n C:   &o  Talk to Izzy. Table\n Izzy\n  &6[Izzy]\n We should be close, but we'll need to spot some landmarks to know exactly where we are. Could you please ask Levyn if he can\nsee anything on the horizon?\n  &5[Sure!]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Splendid, thank you.\n  &5[Sounds like effort.]\n  &6[Captain Indigo]\n Alright, never mind.\n C:   &o  Talk to Levyn. Table\n Levyn\n  &6[Levyn]\n Hello... [Player]... I'm not feeling too good.\n  &5[I thought you were supposed to be a pirate? Are you sea sick?]\n  &6[Levyn]\n Just getting my... sea legs... what do you want?\n  &5[Have you been able to see anything from up here?]\n  &6[Levyn]\n I can't... see straight at all... can you get a sea sickness cure from... Samwell below deck?\n  &5[Sure I'll be right back.]\n  &6[Levyn]\n Thank... you.\n C:   &o  Talk to Samwell. Table\n Samwell\n  &6[Samwell]\n Hello [Player], is there anything you need from the stores?\n  &5[I need a sea sickness cure, Levyn isn't doing too well.]\n  &6[Samwell]\n Ha! I knew that guy was all talk. Here, we have plenty stocked up. I can't wait to finally get my hands on some treasure.\n&o  Samwell's eyes glisten at the thought of treasure.\n Head back to Levyn. Table\n Levyn\n&o  Levyn grabs the cure and drinks it all\n  &6[Levyn]\n Arrgh, thank you matey! I've never felt more swashbuckling before. Now, about that view: I be seeing land in the distance - an\nisland! It be about 40 seaports away. ARRGH!\n C:   &o  Talk to Izzy. Table\n Izzy\n  &6[Izzy]\n Have you found out what Levyn can see yet?\n  &5[He said he could see an island about 40 seaports from here.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Wonderful, I'll steer us that way now. You should go speak with the Captain.\n C:   &o  Talk to Captain Indigo. Table\n Captain Indigo\n  &6[Captain Indigo]\n So you've finally checked in with Izzy. Took you long enough. Looks like we'll arrive shortly.\n  &5[Arrgh.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n PIRATE BOAT INCOMING! EVERYONE TO THE DECK!\n C:   &o  The ship is under attack, get outside quickly!\n  &6[Captain Xeno]\n You have entered the waters of Mistport - my waters - without permission! Prepare to be boarded!\n  &6[Izzy]\n This is bad - we got much closer to Mistport than I expected.\n  &6[Samwell]\n Mistport? I've never heard of such a place. What could we have done wrong by simply getting too close to the island?\n  &6[Izzy]\n If the rumors are true, it's an island ruled over entirely by pirates. We need to find a way to esca-\n  &6[Captain Xeno]\n FIRE!\n&o  The blasts of the ship make your ears ring, and everything goes black.\n&o  You wake up and find yourself in what seems to be a prison.\n C:   &o  You've been imprisoned! Find a way out, and find Izzy and Samwell!!!\n After getting into the sewer:\n  &6[Samwell]\n This trip has sucked so far! We've been captured, imprisoned, and are now wading through a sewer. And we still have no\ntreasure! Maybe I shouldn't have left Nyr... Table\n Izzy\n  &6[Izzy]\n [Player]! Thank goodness you caught up. We felt kind of bad leaving you passed out in your cell, but, you know, pirate code.\n  &5[It's alright, I understand.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Thank you.\n  &5[I'm a bit upset you tried to escape without me.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n It's understandable, but we need to put that aside for now.\n  &6[Izzy]\n Now we just need to find Levyn and then we can figure out how we're going to get off this island.\n  &5[Where is Captain Indigo?]\n  &6[Izzy]\n She is being contained on our ship, which has been impounded on the far side of this port. We'll need to unite the crew before\nwe organize a rescue.\n  &5[Where are we?]\n  &6[Izzy]\n We seem to be in a pirate port. The locals don't seem to like us too much.\n  &5[Where is Levyn?]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Well that's a tough one. He ran ahead yelling something about parlay and rum. My best guess is he was trying to find a pub.\n  &5[I'd better go look for him in a pub then.]\n  &6[Izzy]\n Sounds good. We'll be hiding out here.\n C: &o  Search out Levyn in the Mistport pub. Table\n Levyn\n  Coordinates: [-823, 88, 1367]\n   &6[Levyn]\n If it isn't my favorite drinking buddy [Player]! So good to see you finally join us matey.\n  &5[Levyn, we need to go. We aren't safe here.]\n  &6[Levyn]\n Nonsense! These are our fellow swashbucklers. There was just a slight misunderstanding, that's all.\n  &5[But they threw us in prison.]\n  &6[Levyn]\n Haha yes! Classic mistake that was. Trust me, we're all good now. As long as we can join their ranks we're welcome to stay.\n  &5[No, we shouldn't join them.]\n  &6[Levyn]\n Arrgh! Ye best reconsider your answer.\n  &5[I suppose we can do that.]\n  &6[Levyn]\n Arrgh! Shiver me timbers and a yo ho ho!
