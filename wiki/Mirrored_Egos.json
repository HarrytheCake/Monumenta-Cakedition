Surely, you must know. \n  Color|purple|[No idea buddy.]}} \n  Color|purple|[Are you talking about the moon?]}} \n  Color|orange|[Luc]}} \n The moon? Yes, some would call her that. But isn't she so much more? Illuminating our sleepy town, you can see her in even the slightest glimmer of fresh snow. That glint on both the distance mountain peaks and the icy streets we walk. Chillwind is but a monument to her beauty! \n  Color|purple|[Who are you again?]}} \n  Color|orange|[Luc]}} \n I am Luc. I'm a professor of light magic at our fine academy. Truly the most incredible of the arcane arts. Theatrical but refined! Stunning but practical! One can find absolute power in harnessing her light. \n  Color|purple|[Absolute power?]}} \n  Color|orange|[Luc]}} \n Yes. My research indicates that the light of the moon is quite a magical thing. Entire religious orders have formed around her power. Do you know of the Frost Moon Knights? \n  Color|purple|[I don't think so.]}} \n  Color|purple|[They have been causing problems for the local authorities.]}} \n  Color|orange|[Luc]}} \n Perhaps, but one is more than their worst actions. You cannot be a student of the light without doing proper research! They are a mysterious people that create great monuments in the mountains. I believe I have a book detailing what we know of their history in my family home in the city. My younger sister, Belladonna, should know about it, please bring me that book. \n  Color|purple|[Will do.]}}  \n&o  Speak to Belladonna about the book Luc requested Table  AlignDefault ColWidthDefault AlignDefault \n Belladonna SoftBreak  Coordinates: -1720, 135, -77 AlignDefault \n  Color|gray|She practically ignores you, lost in a book...}} \n  Color|purple|[Are you Belladonna?]}} \n  Color|orange|[Belladonna]}} \n Well excuse me, who said you could burst into my home and interrupt my studies? \n  Color|purple|[Your brother Luc sent me. He's looking for a book on the Frost Moon Knights.]}} \n  Color|orange|[Belladonna]}} \n Oh this book right here? What could he possibly want out of this? His self-righteous light magic could never unlock the moon's dark secrets. How he got a job at the academy is beyond me. I just pray I don't have to take his class next semester... \n  Color|purple|[Oh, you're a student of the academy?]}} \n  Color|orange|[Belladonna]}} \n Duh. I'm staying at home while the dorms are closed. But I'm twice the mage my brother is. His research into light has nothing on my command over the shadows. \n  Color|purple|[You study black magic?]}} \n  Color|orange|[Belladonna]}} \n Oh come on, it's 840. I'm a tenebrist. But yes, you could say I have an affinity towards the darker arts. In fact, I believe I've discovered the location of an artifact that'll show Luc the true power of darkness. I've practically memorized this book anyways, and you look like you've done your fair share of raiding. How about you do a short little favor for me and I'll give Luc the book. It's not like he'd be able to figure it out anyways. \n  Color|purple|[Sure, seems easy enough.]}} \n  Color|orange|[Belladonna]}} \n The Grim Towers are a nearby stronghold of the Frost Moon Knights.

They refer to her as Alutana, goddess of the light. Not only the shimmering body in the sky, but a winged form of pure energy. How marvelous! Imagine the sight! Imagine her magic! I almost feel as if I know her personally, I can practically see her wonder. Oh! Yes! I do know her beauty! A statue rests on the coast to the northeast of here. It must be in her divine image, standing tall with wings and a crown of shining ice. \n  Color|purple|[Should I go check it out?]}} \n  Color|orange|[Luc]}} \n Ha. As if a novice could unlock her secrets. I'll be investigating later, but feel free to bask in her image.

I know exactly where he is headed. Inside the Whitecliffe Citadel, the main fortress of the Frost Moon Knights, there is rumored to be a portal to a mystic realm of darkness. I bet he's after it.

It seems to be just like the one you have.]}} \n  Color|orange|[Belladonna]}} \n This is more serious than I thought. My brother will get himself killed if we don't act fast.
