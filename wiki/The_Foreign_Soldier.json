We have a few leads, but nothing conclusive yet. However, we do still need you for something in the meantime.\n  Color|purple|[What is it?]\n  Color|orange|[Izzy]\n Our reports suggest that both Ishnir and Chillwind royals have gotten word of the exchange of power here in Mistport. That is\nto say, they've likely got their eyes on you.\n  Color|purple|[That seems bad.]\n  Color|orange|[Izzy]\n Not quite. We could use this as a good opportunity to understand a bit more about the war. Given how much we have to watch our\nactions due to the conflicts between the nations, we still understand suprisingly little about what those conflicts are over.\nIt's a tense situation, and the smallest action from either side could lead to actual bloodshed.\n  Color|purple|[So you want me to investigate the war?]\n  Color|orange|[Vargos]\n Indeed. We need you get close with some of the more influential citizens of the Isles, those who likely hold information not\npublicly known. How does that sound to you?\n  Color|purple|[I'll do it.]\n  Color|purple|[Not right now.]\n  Color|orange|[Vargos]\n Fantastic! I've had our sources compile a list of people who might be the best targets. Seek them out, and see what information\nyou can extract from them.\n&o  Seek out the people Vargos has suggested you find.

Can't do much damage to the surrounding areas if we fire out into the ocean, now can we?\n  Color|purple|[I guess I can't argue with that.]\n  Color|orange|[General Arne]\n Say, are you busy right now? You seem like you know your way around a complicated firing mechanism. We are down a man today and\ncould really use some help with setup.\n  Color|purple|[What do you need me to do?]\n  Color|orange|[General Arne]\n Well, the trebuchet's mechanisms have gone a bit crazy today and need a manual reset. Unfortunately, I can't reset it myself,\nas someone needs to stand up here and check all the moving parts as they are manually adjusted. So, if you could go down into\nthe panel room and fix the situation, I would highly appreciate your services.\n  Color|purple|[I think I can manage that.]\n&o  Head down to the control room below the catapult.

This will be perfect for our tests!\n  Color|purple|[Why do you need to test a trebuchet?]\n  Color|orange|[General Arne]\n What a silly question, to make sure it works obviously! However, there is a second reason. You seem trustworthy enough, so I'll\nlet you in on something. Recently, the government has developed a new weapon, similar to a trebuchet, but moveable on land, ice,\nsand, anything! It will be a fantastic asset in the war. We test this trebuchet for experimental data for this new weapon.\n  Color|purple|[Seems powerful.]\n  Color|orange|[General Arne]\n Quite! With this at our disposal, Alnera better watch their backs. Their era of slavery won't last much longer.\n  Color|purple|[Slavery?]\n  Color|orange|[General Arne]\n You've not heard of it? I guess you don't really seem like you're from around here, so let me explain. One of the reasons we\nconflict with Ishnir is the government's abuse towards their people.\n  Color|orange|[General Arne]\n The royals and bureaucrats of Alnera live in luxury, while their lower class, who have been shipped off to Molta, slave day\nafter day in ceaseless mining operations. No rights, no pay. They are slaves to the system, and we strive for a world in which\nthey are free.\n  Color|gray|You likely won't get any more info out of General Arne. Your list has been updated.

Aren't these fungal specimens great?\n  Color|purple|[Why are you keeping mushrooms in your house?]\n  Color|orange|[Kugo]\n Why, I study them, of course. Unfortunately, I can't keep all my specimens here- not enough space. I have to use a storage unit\nI own just down the way to house them all.\n  Color|purple|[What do you research them for?]\n  Color|orange|[Kugo]\n Haha! I couldn\u2019t possibly say! Interests in taking over the world, maybe? Who knows!\n  Color|purple|[Not the answer I was expecting.]\n  Color|orange|[Kugo]\n Hah, I merely jest! I\u2019m a scientist, I study things because they need to be studied. I merely wish I could increase my specimen\nsamples a bit more, ah, the dreams!\n  Color|purple|[Increase how?]\n  Color|orange|[Kugo]\n You see, I have a large array of knowledge of fungal species from Ishnir, and even some from the Viridian region. However, the\nones that elude me come from the Chillwind. I hear stories of a large fungal forest that exists there, crystalline mushrooms of\nenormous size! Ah, how I wish I could get a sample of it. Alas, I'm much too busy with my current studies to make time to travel\nthere.\n  Color|purple|[I could probably get a sample for you.]\n  Color|orange|[Kugo]\n Really?! That would be fantastic!

Specifically, I am a researcher for the government. They...\nthey took an interest in my knowledge of fungal species, and wanted me to determine a way to destroy the crystalline shroom\nforest in Chillwind...\n  Color|purple|[Why would they want that?]\n  Color|orange|[Kugo]\n I... I don't know. The war ravages all, I suppose. But... after seeing this specimen, I... I can't let that happen. A species\nsuch as this, where its very being is intertwined with crystalline essence, is incredibly rare. I refuse to let them destroy\nsuch a thing.\n  Color|gray|You likely won't get any more info out of Kugo. Your list has been updated.

Besides, I'm quite on edge\nright now, so startling me is not the best idea. I've got a lot on my plate.\n  Color|purple|[What has you on edge?]\n  Color|orange|[Ambassador Matori]\n Just... the war, I suppose. It makes my job as the Ambassador of Chillwind a... rough position, to say the least. All of my\ndays are spent hearing constant yelling, and battle strategies, and equally horrid plans of action. I... guess I just long for\ndays of peace.\n  Color|purple|[Is there anything I can do to help?]\n  Color|orange|[Ambassador Matori]\n Ha! Can you solve hundreds of years of political turmoil in a day? That'd be swell. That said, I would love a nice cup of tea.\nNot just any tea, Royal Red tea, some of the most delicious tea in all of Ishnir.

My thoughts can finally\nclear up from...\n  Color|purple|[From?]\n  Color|orange|[Ambassador Matori]\n Well, I was just thinking about Wispervale, one of the more contentious points of our conflicts with the Chillwind. It comes up\nquite a bit in war strategy meetings. You see, one of the reasons we conflict so heavily with the Chillwind due to their\nobsessive hatred against the use of magic. They hunt down magic users like dogs, and have even subjected some to public\nexecutions.\n  Color|orange|[Ambassador Matori]\n The people of Ishnir simply wish for a world where magic can freely be used by everyone, and Wispervale is an outpost for such\nideals, stationed right in the heart of the Chillwind. They are subjugated for their use of magic, but one day, they will be\nfree.\n  Color|purple|[Why does-]\n  Color|orange|[Ambassador Matori]\n Ooo! Seems my tea is ready!

I won't pretend I understand the political turmoil here, but there must be a common\nunderlying reason that the conflicts restarted recently. If I had to make a guess...\n  Color|orange|[Izzy]\n I hate to interrupt here, but I've just gotten word that we have some visitors on the island.\n  Color|purple|[Visitors?]\n  Color|orange|[Izzy]\n It seems our hunch was correct, the royals of the nations did have their eyes on you, and they've each sent an emissary to\nspeak with the new captain of Mistport.\n  Color|purple|[What should we do?]\n  Color|orange|[Vargos]\n Well      Color|purple|[Why would we do that?]\n  Color|orange|[Vargos]\n Think about it, our connections in the Isles are sparse, and we can only accomplish so much. If we allied ourselves with one of\nthe nations, this would give us access to their vast information network.
