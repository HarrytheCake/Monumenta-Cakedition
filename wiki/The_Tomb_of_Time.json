Meeting the Crimson King is worth the\nrisk. As long as you're still in.\n  &5[I'm not yet.]\n  &6[Vargos]\n Let me know if you change your mind. The Isles are at risk...\n  &5[I am.]\n  &6[Vargos]\n Then it's decided. We'll send an excavation team to the Silver Tower where you said the place collapsed when you found the\nSilver Knight... Goodness, those words seem wild to say.     Color|teal|{...}\n  &6[Bhairavi]\n I'm a bit worried, but we're committed. Another excavation, at last. I think we can help. Zarek? Pten? Why don\u2019t you two\naccompany [Player]? Pten oversaw our excavation of C'Zanil's tomb, and Zarek is a powerful mage in their own right who can\neasily help carve debris.

There's just been a lot going on.]\n  &6[Pten]\n Let's get moving. This situation makes me quite uncomfortable...\n  &5[Yes, let's.

This doesn't look good at all...\n  &5[What did Teal do?!]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  &5[Do what you must.]\n  &6[Pten]\n This is horrifying. Such damage in such a beautifully different area. This place looks nothing like the Chillwind I recognize.\nTruly a much older work. Sorry, the archaeologist in me is coming out...\n  &5[I'm not sure who built it, just that it housed the Lime Wool for a time before Salazar claimed it.]\n  &6[Pten]\n From the limited encounter, this place seems populated by scavengers who claimed artifacts of these Silver Knights. I wonder if\nthey knew what they had.

Can you reach them from here?]\n  &6[Zarek]\n Absolutely. I\u2019ll give them a buzz.

I've done it before!\n  &5[Alright then, let's see what we can find.]\n  &6[Pten]\n Ready to go?\n  &5[Nope.]\n  &6[Pten]\n Then get ready.

I'm not sure how far we've gone, but I'm really exhausted... Should we head\nthrough that doorway across the bridge and then set up some camp?\n  &5[Sure. I wanna poke around before we do too much else though. That statue seems interesting...]\n  &6[Pten]\n Be careful. We have no idea what kind of defenses the Isharistians would have established.

Table\n The Crimson King ( Link   Silver Knight's Tomb Silver_Knight's_Tomb wikilink Story mode)\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  I can sense Time itself being distorted here. Not all of this place is from this time. Rifts are opening... Explore what lies\nbefore us and find the Rifts, [Player]. It might be our only way forward.\n  Rift The Lyrata: 90 207 333\n Rift Timetorn Legionary: 105 237 457\n Rift Infernal Flame: 19 246 398\n Rift Timesick Duo: 100 275 296\n  After beating first rift:\n  The time rift fades away as you land the finishing blow, and you find yourself back where you were.\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  These beings have been ripped out of time... With them though, comes memories. Teal was here, exploring the past to find a way\nthrough to the Knight hiding deeper within. There was a guardian, called the Silver Construct. Teal destroyed it and scattered\nits pieces through these rifts to stop anyone following him into... whatever is next? Perhaps if we can find and close all of\nthe Rifts, we can restore the Guardian and use it?\n After beating second rift:\n  The time rift fades away as you land the finishing blow, and you find yourself back where you were.\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  Another piece of the Silver Construct! I can feel it reforming in the present. I am not sure what it will do once we have\ncompleted it, but I can feel its power beginning to collect in the cathedral on the hill to the north. I can see a powerful\nmemory of the mighty Knights of Lyrata attempting desperately to hold it off as other mighty heroes stood firm, prepared to turn\nit away. A duo of warriors, a master of forges, and something stranger still. Incredible.\n After beating third rift:\n  The time rift fades away as you land the finishing blow, and you find yourself back where you were.\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  Another rift, another part of the Construct. These guardians seem to be vital recollections of the elements of the Construct\nitself, each involved in its eventual destruction. We are getting closer to completing our task. I sense the place beyond the\ncathedral but I'm struggling to understand its purpose... The Forge?\n After beating fourth rift:\n  The time rift fades away as you land the finishing blow, and you find yourself back where you were.\n  A loud rumbling emanates from the Cathedral, echoing through the city as the final time rift collapses.\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  Yes. The Forge. The Knights made... they made wool there. This is why I have been sent here, is it not? It is not just to help\nyou capture Teal... It is to remake my Home. I understand now. I have found the last piece of the Construct as you battled, but\nsomething is strange. I tried to pull all of the memories together, much like I did the Monument in the Isles, but it did not\nwork. My power is not working well here. ange. But the Construct still arrived. It has been waiting to be reforged... I do not\nthink it will let us pass peacefully.\n After going through the Cathedral:\n&o  C: The Tomb of Time: Defeat the Silver Construct!\n  &6[Silver Construct]\n UNAUTHORIZED ENTITY DETECTED: IMPLEMENTING REMOVAL PROCEDURE.\n After getting to 50% health:\n  &6[Silver Construct]\n INTERNAL DAMAGE CRITICAL: REALIGNING CURRENT DIRECTIVE: DESTROY INTRUDERS.\n After beating the Imperial Construct:\n  &6[Silver Construct]\n PRIME DIRECTIVE FAILED: TOMB HAS BEEN BREACHED.

Table\n The Crimson King ( Link   Silver Knight's Tomb Silver_Knight's_Tomb wikilink Story mode Forge)\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  We are here, at last, in the Forge of the Silver Knights. Let us enter the heart of these flames and craft a blank wool, like\nthe Knights have done so many times before. If not at this Forge, then at another they have created.\n  &5[So the Silver Knights make the wool themselves?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  In a way. Whenever a wool was needed, they would craft the prison, specialized for the being they sought to contain, but I do\nnot know from what. We will need a specialized one to contain the Malefactor too. There will be guardians though. If we can\ndefeat them, I can take from them the memories they hold and we can craft the wool ourselves. Together.\n  &5[Together. Should we craft a second wool for you?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  Home is... so... close. But no. Not yet. We have to handle Teal first. You really held up your end of the contract, [Player],\nand I cannot thank you enough for it.\n Defeat the mini bosses that spawn (Dialogue when mini boss spawns):\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  Argentel... Your death shall grant me strength to shape the power.\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  Fulgar... Your death shall grant me the heat of the forge.\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  Procursus... Your death shall grant me the focus to finish this craft, the mightiest of wool, ready to hold firm.\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  Medice... Your death shall grant me incantation to power this prison.\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  Bothnys... Your death shall grant me accuracy to shape the form.\n After beating all 5 mini bosses: Table\n The Crimson King ( Link   Silver Knight's Tomb Silver_Knight's_Tomb wikilink Story mode Forge Completion)\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  It is done. Together we have crafted a new wool. It is blank now. Soon we shall grant it a color. It is time to enter the\ncrypt itself, where the Silver Knight lies. Where the Malefactor himself waits for us. I need you to know I will not be of much\nhelp in this coming fight, however.\n  &5[Why? What happened?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  The power it took to craft this wool and make manifest the knowledge to do so has left me drained. Something about this place\nhas dampened my power significantly. Hopefully the same is true for Teal.\n  &5[I hope so.]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  If this is the end of our time together, our last peaceful moment, I thank you for all you have done. This has been something\nI will keep in my memory forever.\n  &5[Thank you. You\u2019ve, surprisingly, been a true ally. Let\u2019s finish this, Vaessini. Let\u2019s get you Home.]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  Yes. It is time. Onward.

At its end, you will surely find the very core of Orasomn's being. If you can manage to\ncollect it, our time here will draw to an end.\n&o  C: At last, recapture the Teal Spirit into a Wool. Table\n The Crimson King ( Link   Silver Knight's Tomb Silver_Knight's_Tomb wikilink Story mode End)\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  I offer you the blank wool. Take it. Use it.\n  &5[Right...]\n  &6[Orasomn Core]\n  you cannot... no. all i have worked for. all i have done for freedom. you are not strong enough to contain me!\n  &5[You've threatened the safety of the entire world. There is no place for you here. It's time to go.]\n  &6[Orasomn Core]\n  i have the power of the entire empire at my control. i will not be contained for long. there is nothing you can do to keep me\nlocked away. your cheaply made wool is useless.\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  But there is plenty I can do. I do not need to be within my own wool. My home is long-destroyed. But I can find solace here.\nThe jailed becomes the jailer. I will go within the wool as well, and keep Teal quelled. This is what has always been meant for\nme, has it not? Teal and I have been forever entwined since the day the Knights captured him with my help. We shall thus be\nentwined forever more within one wool of power. Do it. Now. Before it is too late.\n  &5[Are you sure?]\n  &6[The Crimson King]\n  I have never been more sure of anything. Seal us away. The pedestal is nearby, I can feel it. Let me go home.\n  &5[Very well, then. Goodbye, Vaessini.]\n  &6[Orasomn Core]\n  NO! YOU WILL NEVER CONTAIN ME!
