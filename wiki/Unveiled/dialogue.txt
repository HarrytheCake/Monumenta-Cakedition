 Greetings! Up here you can buy some of the finest magical and alchemical supplies in the land. All designed by yours truly of
course.
  &5[Do you know anything about Mistleaves?]
  &6[Josiah]
 Yes, and I can make a mistleaf key, but... why would you possibly want one? It takes some serious dark magic to put that
together and I can't think of any practical use.
  &5[A prisoner said it's the only way inside the Verdant Fortress' inner sanctum.]
  &6[Josiah]
 ... You want to go into the Inner Sanctum...? You're insane. But, you did help save Highwatch, so if anyone can do it I guess
it'll be you.
  &5[I've dealt with dark magic before.]
  &6[Josiah]
 You know that doesn't fill me with confidence. But you did help save Highwatch, so I'm going to hope you have a good reason for
this.
  &5[It's top secret.]
  &6[Josiah]
 I understand. Considering everything you've pulled off before though, I'm sure it'll be something impressive.
  &6[Josiah]
 Alright, I have most of the ingredients I need in order to make you a Mistleaf Key, I'll just need you to bring me two things;
a dozen fresh Mistleaves and a magic wand imbued with dark magic.
  &5[Where can I find Mistleaves?]
  &6[Josiah]
 Mistleaves tend to grow in the center of fairy circles and other strongly magical locations. The forest nearby is probably the
best shot, but be wary, it's a dangerous place. Twelve should be enough to weave the key together.
  &5[Where can I find such a wand?]
  &6[Josiah]
 Maybe you could find such a wand in the graveyard? I've heard that a powerful sorcerer was buried down there, perhaps such a
foul wand would be inside his tomb?
&o  Work with Josiah on the magic to learn how to infiltrate the Sons of the Forest's fortress.
 The 12 Mistleaves can be found in   Link   Cursed Forest Cursed_Forest wikilink  .
 The Staff can be found in the depths of the   Link   Graveyard Graveyard wikilink  . Table
 Josiah
  &6[Josiah]
 Mistleaves and a Wand of Blood! Just what I needed. Now... the thing with a Mistleaf Key is that they're very vulnerable to
powerful magic. I'll make a few and send them ahead to Hayne's explosive general, and hang onto one to give to you directly.
Until then, you should check back in with Haynes, I think she has a plan.
&o  Talk to Haynes and get her plan of attack on the fortress. Table
 Commander Haynes
  &6[Commander Haynes]
 Excellent, it sounds like Josiah's ready to go. But invisibility alone won't be enough; any disturbance in the Sons of the
Forest's inner sanctum and their full force will come running. Which means we'll need a distraction.
  &5[What kind of distraction?]
  &6[Commander Haynes]
 I ordered something subtle, but I think enough explosives to level a small town will suffice.
  &5[How about explosives?]
  &6[Commander Haynes]
 Precisely. Enough explosives to level a small town should make a great distraction.
  &5[Why not burn them out?]
  &6[Commander Haynes]
 Heh, close enough. I was thinking enough explosives to level a small town.
  &6[Commander Haynes]
 Lieutenant Kathryn, my chief bombardier, is in position setting up her cannons. Look to the treetops near their Verdant
Fortress and see what she needs for the assault.
&o  Haynes smiles.
&o  Meet with Kathryn in the treetops near the fortress and help her prepare the bombardment. Table

   &6[Kathryn]
 You're not supposed to be up here! This is secret! Clandestine! Classif-ah whatever. Just don't touch anything or this whole
forest might explode.
  &5[Haynes sent me. She said you're going to bombard the fortress.]
  &6[Kathryn]
 That's right, but there's a catch. If bombing them were that easy we'd have wiped them off the face of the earth thirty years
ago. First problem: the fortress itself is immensely strong and none of my explosives can actually breach it. Believe me, I've
tried.
  &5[Can't we just use more explosives?]
  &6[Kathryn]
 I wish it worked that way. Shaping, stacking, chaining, nothing worked!
  &5[So we need stronger explosives?]
  &6[Kathryn]
 Bingo! Regular TNT, alchemical potions, bomb arrows, nothing worked!
  &6[Kathryn]
 I need stronger explosives. Find me an expert on fire. Explosives. Lava. Anything! As long as I can get something better than
regular TNT, we can blow this fortress into rubble! Try asking around Farr, I've heard there's an old alchemist who lives there.
&o  Search for an alchemist who can teach you how to make stronger explosives. Table

   &6[Carbocius]
 Look at this, old chap, these paleocurrents are lovely. Oooh, and we... you didn't come here to listen to me ramble, did you.
What did you want?
  &5[Do you know anything about explosives?]
  &6[Carbocius]
 I, uh, no! No, of course not! I don't know anything about Hyper TNT. Why, I've never even heard of it!
  &5[Hyper TNT?]
  &6[Carbocius]
 I... uh.... um... Just, just forget I mentioned it. I developed it back while working in the old Alchemy Labs, before the spill
happened, but it's entirely too dangerous for anyone to use!
&o
  &6[Carbocius]
 Good evening, what did you need? Please don't tell me you were still going to ask about that hyper TNT again.
  &5[Sooo... Hyper TNT?]
  &6[Carbocius]
 *sigh* I already told you, it's too dangerous! I never even published it! The only place that recipe exists is in my head and
my notes in that old workshop.
  &5[When did you retire from alchemy?]
  &6[Carbocius]
 Oh, about fifteen years ago. All the fumes just didn't seem healthy anymore and so I turned to my second passion, geology.
  &5[Where in the labs did you work?]
  &6[Carbocius]
 When the alchemy labs shut down and we moved to the current labs they put me near that giant water vat next to the castle since
all my explosives kept, well, exploding.
  &5[Why did you move to Farr?]
  &6[Carbocius]
 Oh, it was an easy choice. So many fascinating geologic features nearby, and unlike Sierhaven, I never have to worry about
anyone popping out of secret tunnels. They're everywhere down there, even underwater! Why, one even led to my workshop so I
always got unwelcome guests.
  &5[Where did you test explosives?]
  &6[Carbocius]
 Well, they didn't totally shut down the alchemy labs. One wing of it got converted into an underground bunker for testing. We
had to keep a huge water vat right above it though, so we could flood it in case anything got out of control.
&o  Find Carbocius's old laboratory and use it to make the Hyper TNT!
  The Lab is reached via the water vat in front of Sierhaven castle [-750, 106, -71].
 To get into the water vat you can either enter the Arcane Emporium, climb up the ladder at [-774, 108, -54] and swim along the
channel to get into the water vat or you can go up to the third floor of the castle and bounce via the slimes into

 That... that TNT! It's so unstable! Dangerous! Destructive! It's absolutely perfect. I'll prep the cannons, go pick up the
Mistleaf Key Josiah was crafting and we'll get to it!

  &6[Kathryn]
 Hey, you made it! After that awesome explosion I had to come check out what we'd done. Now, listen carefully. To truly destroy
their sanctum you'll need to break more spell crystals inside their Inner Sanctum. Someone in there is casting a massive spell
to keep this place shielded from magical sight. Maybe you can stop it. Maybe the Jungle will help you once you've cleared their
spell?
  &5[I'm ready.]
  &6[Kathryn]
 Great. Do you still have the key Josiah gave you? If you need another one or lost the one he gave you, I can sell you one.
They're not easy to make, ya know. Good luck in there!

 Beautiful, isn't it. A Black Shard, shorn from the Black Wool itself. I don't know how you survived me once, but I am

  &6[Josiah]
 You vanished right after you touched the Black Shard! What happened in there!? Did you get the Shard?
  &5[I was pulled into Kaul's nightmare.]
  &6[Josiah]
 Oh. Oh wow. That... doesn't sound right. I've heard old Tlaxan stories and it sounded like his dreams were supposed to be
pleasant - thoughts of nature and life. They must have been corrupted by the ritual the Sons of the Forest were doing.
  &5[I didn't get the shard, but I touched it.]
  &6[Josiah]
 Wild, I can still feel the trace of power it left on you. I'm not sure how we'll get it out of the Inner Sanctum. Try talking
to Antonio downstairs, he makes all the armor here and might be able to channel that power into something productive.
 C:   &o  Work with Mastersmith Antonio to imbue an item with the Black Shard's power. Table

 The BLACK WOOL?! How did you get that?
  &5[The Sons of the Forest had it. I stopped them.]
  &6[Mastersmith Antonio]
 That's fantastic! Let me see the magical signature you're carrying so I can study how to infuse it, but I believe it can imbue
any item with   Link   Hope Hope wikilink  . When you know what item you'd like to infuse with   Link   Hope Hope wikilink  ,
hold it and speak to me again.
