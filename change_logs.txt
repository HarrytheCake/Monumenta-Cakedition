&bClass Changes&r
&nWarrior&r
• Brute Force : Fixed an issue where this ability applied Other
type damage instead of Melee Skill damage to prevent the ability
from gaining damage buffs/debuffs twice. In effect, this means
the ability now consistently works with all damage buffs/debuffs
and Berserker's Rampage.
• Rampage :
  • L1 : Gain a Rage stack every 50 -> 75 damage
  • L2 : Gain a Rage stack every 35 -> 50 damage
  • &oDeveloper Note: Since Rampage now accounts for Brute Force
damage, its thresholds have been increased. Overall, this should
still be a buff to Berserker's kit and allow for greater
specialization ability diversity.&r
&nCleric&r
• Divine Justice : Weapons with Cumbersome now use the weapon's
base damage for damage calculations and no longer give the
critical melee hit damage bonus
• Luminous Infusion :
  • Dealing 300/450 -> 200/300 damage against a Boss grants 1
stack of Luminousity
  • Consume one stack of Luminousity to trigger Divine Justice
for 20% -> 30% of your critical attack damage
  • &oDeveloper Note: Luminous Infusion's ability to exchange
Luminousity to buff Divine Justice was not performing
adequately, even in builds that try to take full advantage of
it. This change should make it a better option for single-target
burst damage.&r
&nScout&r
• Quickdraw : Base Projectile damage now scales per region. R1 =
11, R2 = 17, R3 = 22
• Pinning Shot : No longer triggers if the projectile was
launched by a Volley initiated by Quickdraw
• Split Arrow : No longer triggers if the projectile was
launched by a Volley initiated by Quickdraw
  • &oDeveloper Note: Pinning Shot and Split Arrow were
originally not designed with Quickdraw in mind. Because Volley
is already an excellent area-of-effect clear ability and
Quickdraw allows one to bypass projectile weapon charge time,
this interaction has been removed to tone down Scout's area-of-
effect potential.&r
&bCharm Changes&r
&nWarrior Charms&r
• Loci's Hunger (Rework) : -5 Rampage Stacks Needed For
Activation, +30% Rampage Damage, +30% Rampage Radius, -0.3%
Rampage Resistance Per Stack
  • &oDeveloper Note: The previous iteration of this charm
failed to achieve its design goal of allowing for fast Rampage
cycling. This new iteration should fulfill that niche
adequately.&r
&nCleric Charms&r
• Martial Mantra : +20% -> +30% Luminous Infusion Damage
Multiplier
&nScout Charms&r
• Lesser Quickshot Charm : +15% -> +7% Quickdraw Damage
• Greater Quickshot Charm : +20% -> +15% Quickdraw Damage
• Focused Quickshot Charm : +35% -> +25% Quickdraw Damage
• Swift Quickshot Charm : +10% -> +7% Quickdraw Damage
&nWarlock Charms&r
• Impmaster's Fiddle : +2 -> +3 Restless Souls Vex Cap, +10% ->
+15% Restless Souls Damage
• Windeater Icon (Rework) : 2 Charm Power, +50% Restless Souls
Movement Speed, +25% Restless Souls Damage, -25% Restless Souls
Duration
  • &oDeveloper Note: This charm's previous iteration was a
statistical upgrade over Impmaster's Fiddle. After re-evaluating
the niches of both charms, Impmaster's Fiddle has received a
buff to better fill its niche while Windeater Icon has been
reworked to improve Restless Souls' efficiency in combat.
&b&rLoot Changes&r
• Vigora now sells 3 -> 6 Eyes of Viridia for 1 Hyper
Crystalline Shard
&bItem Changes&r
&nKing's Valley&r
• Highwatch Pike : 11 -> 13 Projectile Damage
&nCelsian Isles&r
• Hrimnir's Incisor (Rework) : Ethereal 1, Ice Aspect 2, Second
Wind 1, Two Handed, Unbreaking 3, 19 Attack Damage, 1.4 Attack
Speed
  • &oDeveloper Note: The previous iteration of this item was
difficult to build around due to its low attack speed and Two
Handed enchantment. This version intends to grant additional
tanking potential that synergizes with Reaper's ability kit
without making its build limitations implausible to
accomodate.&r
&nThe Architect's Ring&r
• Air-Purified Thresher (M4) (Rework) : Knockback 1, Bleeding 2,
First Strike 2, Unbreaking 7, 17 Attack Damage, 1.6 Attack
Speed, +10% Speed
  • &oDeveloper Note: The previous interation of this item did
not function well with either of Warlock's specializations. This
new version is intended to be a well-rounded option with mid-
range attack speed.&r
• Cresent of Dominion (M4) : 14 -> 15 Attack Damage
• Death's Echo (M3 and M4) : 0 -> +1 Armor
• Eschar Dreamcatcher (M4) : 17.5 -> 18 Attack Damage
• Fading Horizon (M4) : 14.5 -> 15.5 Attack Damage
• Harrakfar's Claw (M4) : 17 -> 18 Attack Damage
• Last Respects (M4) : 16 -> 17 Attack Damage
• Nalatia's Galeblade (M4) : 16 -> 17 Attack Damage
• Reaper's Harvest EX (M4) : 15.5 -> 17 Attack Damage
• Seafarer's Rapier (M4) : 17 -> 18 Attack Damage
• Thalassic Cinders (M4) : 19 -> 21 Attack Damage
• Veinshredder (M4) : 16 -> 17.5 Attack Damage
• Will of the Codex (M4) : 4 -> 3 Duelist
• Woolwoven Staff (M4) : 10 -> 15 Decay~~lukewarmfix~~
