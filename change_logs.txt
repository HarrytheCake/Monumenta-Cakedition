&bMajor Balance Change: The Additive Damage Rework&r
&nIntroduction:&r
After well over a year of development and several weeks of
testing and bug fixing, the balance team is pleased to release a
major overhaul to damage calculations we've termed the Additive
Damage Rework. Under the previous system, all non-flat damage
buffs were multiplicative • damage buffs become greater than the
sum of their parts very quickly. This led to the following
issues:
• There was a large spread between median and maximum damage
output. This led to issues designing mob and boss encounters
since health values would either be excessive for average
players or low for optimal group compositions.
• High damage gear, class buffs, infusions, and other damage
enhancements were required for high level content. Not using
these tools meant significant underperformance in comparison
even if skill levels and strategies between groups were held
constant.
• Many classes had an advantage over others due to innate damage
stacking or were limited to prevent excessive damage output. For
example, the base damage of Alchemist Potions between Region 2
and Region 3 were near identical due to damage buffs in Region
3.&nSummary of Changes:&r
&bSimplified New Formula:&r
`Total Damage = Base Weapon Damage &o Critical Melee Hit &r (1 +
Gear Damage + Situational Enchant Damage + Infusion Damage) &o
(1 + All other multipliers combined) &r (1 • Mob Resistance) +
Flat Damage`
For a detailed breakdown of the old and new damage formulas and
an explanation of terms, see the text document below.
The spread between the median and maximum damage achievable has
been significantly reduced, and many class skills and items have
received damage increases to compensate. We took this
opportunity to reduce the damage output of some classes that
were significantly outperforming others due to damage stacking,
but these calculations are left vague to allow the community to
check our work without knowing what the supposed outcomes are.
For players that did not take full advantage of damage buffs,
your damage output should remain the same or increase. You may
read a list of changes in the provided text document.
&nFinal Thoughts:&r
Due to the broad scope of these changes, we likely missed
something or introduced new bugs to the game. We will roll out a
few balance patches outside of our normal monthly cycle to
address these issues in the coming weeks. You are encouraged to
report bugs as soon as you find them to https://discord.com/chan
nels/313066655494438922/569283901202366524 or the @ModMail bot
depending on their severity.
It is our hope that these changes will provide a better
experience for players and help us deliver better balanced, high
quality content in the future. Thanks for your continued
enjoyment and support of Monumenta!
&bMinor New Features:&r
• Added a new epic cosmetic skill set for Cleric, which can be
acquired from a certain NPC after withstanding the greatest pain
the mind can suffer
• Added new spawning sound effects for all delve mobs
• You can now load classes from a yellow tesseract when you
don't have one selected
• Messages from players are now received as system messages
rather than player messages. This is due to Mojang dropping
support for unsigned player messages, and also only briefly
supporting signed messages with custom formatting. While these
changes are not strictly required on 1.19.4, it will make
transitioning to future versions easier.
• Added /report <player> <reason> to report a player that is
breaking the rules directly to the moderation team in-game.

moved and still have them work
