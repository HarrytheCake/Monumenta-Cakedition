&b(11.46.0)&r
For the update on December 10, 2025
### Minor New Features:
• Added an API for Depths skills, accessible at
https://api.playmonumenta.com/depths_skills (will become
available sometime during weekly update)
## Alchemist Rework Week 1 Changelog
&bFixes:&r
• Fixed Collapsing Fragment MW3 not having a Potion Recharge
Rate stat
• Fixed Insanity (Unstable Amalgam) charms having the wrong
Knockback Speed stat, making it do nothing
• Fixed base Volatile charms not being in the API
• (hotfixed) Fixed Brine's Gambit making Alchemical Artillery
explode instantly upon cast
• (hotfixed) Fixed damage calculation for Brutal DoT refreshes
&bNew changes:&r
• Rebalanced Taboo:
  • Level 1:
    • Removed the Cast/Recast system. You once again activate
Taboo, and decide when to deactivate it. Activating Taboo
doesn't cost a potion anymore.
    • You can now activate and deactivate Taboo without holding
an Alchemist Bag.
    • You now lose 2.5% of your HP every second, and every time
this happens, the HP loss increases by 0.6%. If the health loss
reaches 10% HP per second, you also start losing 10% of your max
HP in absorption every second.
    • Received new sounds that ramp up with the HP loss
    • The health loss is now smoother instead of coming in big
chunks.
    • +25 -> +30% Magic Damage
    • 10s Cooldown
  • Level 2:
    • +35 -> +40% Magic Damage
    • Deactivating Taboo now gives you 1 absorption health (max
of 10) for every 10% of your HP that is missing. The absorption
lasts 8s.> Notes: A ramping HP loss is a much nicer design to
prevent the "perma taboo" gameplay and actually putting a
significant risk/reward factor into the gameplay loop of the
ability. The potion cost of the ability really hurt slower bags,
and it felt like an unnecessary "extra cost" when HP drain is
already a pretty big cost by itself. The level 2 now offers a
unique "bailout" mechanic which allows you to push Taboo even
further and mitigate the bad consequences of doing so.
-# The Bell tolls warning Those who dare risk too much, for
their Time is almost up…
• Rebalanced Energizing Elixir:
  • Level 1:
    • The ability hotbar now shows how much time you have left
on your elixir effect.
    • Your potions now leave a faint 5 block high cloud, with
125% of your potion's radius, that lingers for 1s. Immediately,
and every 0.5s, standing in the cloud gives you the effects of
elixir.
  • Level 2:
    • 10 -> 15% damage buff, 4 -> 8s duration. The effect is now
applied by the cloud too.
  • Enhancement:
    • Gruesome potions now reduce all types of debuffs, not just
Vanilla Potion ones.
> Notes: This aims to address valid complaints about difficulty
to use the new Elixir ability. The cylindrical hitbox and the
added radius multiplier should help make it a lot more
consistent and should also help players with high ping. The
lingering cloud can help as sort of a delayed way to still gain
the effects when you're just outside the hitbox, and move into
it. Players can only be affected by one cloud at a time.
• Rebalanced Volatile Reaction:
  • The "level upgrade" effect has been moved to Level 1.
  • Level 2's damage increase now also affects the damage of the
first explosion, unlike previously.
  • The AoE detonation damage is no longer applied to the mob
that was detonated
  • Mobs spreading the Enhancement's DoT can now spread it to
themselves if they are the highest hp enemy in range• The
Enhancement DoT spread no longer targets mobs immune to magic
damage, or mobs that should be ignored by summons
  • Fixed Volatile 1 (u) having two explosions.
> Notes: I felt like level 2 was too loaded with effects, and
triggering Volatile enemies with Gruesome while only having
Level 1 didn't do much (just spreads Gruesome to nearby enemies,
which you likely already hit with your first potion anyway).
Moving the "level upgrade" effect to Volatile 1 makes it more
appealing and fixes the Gruesome application problem, while
keeping the appeal of two explosions on Level 2.
• Bezoar:
  • Enhancement: Philosopher's Stones now glow Red
• Rebalanced Scorched Earth:
  • Level 1: 50 -> 40% Scorched damage
  • Level 2: 60 -> 50% Scorched Damage; the cooldown is no
longer reduced
> Notes: Just a slight nerf as the ability was overperforming
just by itself.
• Rebalanced Esoteric Enhancements:
  • 4 -> 5s Cooldown
> Notes: Just a small "nerf" as the ability really didn't need
the cooldown decrease, and it was left in as an artefact of a
previous change.
