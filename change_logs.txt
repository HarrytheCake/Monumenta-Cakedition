Class Changes:
• Paladin's Luminous Infusion level 2 has been reworked to the
following: `The damage is increased to 32 against undead and 16
against non-undead. Undead are passively set on fire for 3s when
damaged, but Inferno is applied at 50% efficiency for magic and
projectile attacks. Cooldown: 10s.`
  • &oDeveloper Note: Region 3 Paladin previously held the
record for the highest damage per minute in most situations by a
wide margin. For example, by using a fully infused damage set
with appropriate damage buffs against a single-target Boss, a
Paladin could deal 30% more damage than the next best performer,
Berserker. The main damage sources Paladins were using to
achieve this were Divine Justice and Luminous Infusion 2, which
provided multiplicative damage buffs. This change removes the
old functionality of Luminous Infusion 2 as Divine Justice 3 and
makes it more useful for caster Paladin. We will likely make
changes to Divine Justice's damage formula in later patches to
reduce its complexity and implement smoother damage scaling
throughout the regions.&r
### Enchantment Changes:
• Decay : 1 -> 2 damage per tick
  • &oDeveloper Note: This change is meant to keep Decay builds
viable in Region 3 despite the removal of generalist Decay
charms without bloating Decay levels to excessively high
numbers. As such, most R1 and R2 items have received Decay level
decreases.&r
• First Strike : Now applies to the following damage types:
Projectile skills, Melee skills (if melee damage was dealt in
the same tick), and Melee Enchantments (if melee damage was
dealt in the same tick). Previously it only applied to Melee and
Projectile damage types.### Item Changes:
