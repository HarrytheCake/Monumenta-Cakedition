&bTeal:&r
Due to an ongoing number of significant bugs and issues that
have occurred since our dungeon instances switched over to world
instancing, the Echoes of Oblivion dungeon has received a
significant mechanical overhaul. For affected gameplay, you can
find the following changes:
• When returning to the start of the dungeon via Max, the
transition will now occur faster and more reliably
• Transferring between eras is now considerably more reliable
• White and Cyan Tesseracts can no longer be used in Era 4,
including the cutscene, race, and loot room
• Items in the relic room are now always present, and no longer
require dropping into the water to spawn/respawn
• Dying/logging out in Era 4, failing the race, and choosing a
relic now all automatically assign and send you to a loot room
without need for stepping on pressure plates
• If the cutscene is not skipped, only one person in a group
must now click the dialogue in order for the entire group to
progress
• Finishing the dungeon while progressing through Unmasked will
no longer try to automatically send you back to Isles after the
final cutscene, and instead drop you back in the starting room
• Players not present when the group proceeds to Era 4 may now
claim a loot room by speaking to Max in Era 3. Loot found in
loot rooms is still determined by the number of Time Crystals
collected
&bprior&r to anyone advancing to Era 4.
