&bHotfix&r:
• The Gallery pass mission now requires 40 rounds as stated in
the descriptionHello!
I've just deployed a completely new version of the API: it has
been rewritten (with new technologies) to make it more
maintainable and future-proof.
I have also added documentation at the base url,
<https://api.playmonumenta.com/>, which now informs you about
all the available paths.
For now, the new API should behave
&bexactly like the previous version&r (if not slightly better) •
basically you should not notice the change.
(if you do notice something different or not behaving, or things
that used to work are now broken, please let me know!)
