and select `I want to unlock this shop`.

of this change.
&bHotfixes:&r
• Fixed logging out in Celestial Zenith after triggering Rebirth

sending the player to the lootroom, as if they logged out while

&bMarket Plugin: Filters • Part. 1/3&r
A new button has appeared in the browser: it adds the ability to
select one of 9 pre-made filters, to help you search specific
items more efficiently.
• Filter 1: No filters. Pretty much what you had previously.
• Filter 2: Shows only King's Valley items.
• Filter 3: Shows only Celsian Isles items.
• Filter 4: Shows only Architect's Ring items.
• Filter 5: Shows items that aren't from any regions (vanilla
item, simple lore stuff, or some QoL items like Firmament)
• Filter 6: Shows only items that have a Region:Tier tag.
• Filter 7: Opposite of Filter 6
• Filter 8: Items considered either armor, or off-hand.
• Filter 9: Opposite of Filter 8
Once you have selected a filter, you will have to press the new
shiny refresh button.
This week, those filters are not editable. Next week, they
should be.
This corresponds to part 2/3, which will bring the ability to
add/edit your own custom filters.
We are aware the pre-made filters given this week will not be
enough for all your specific needs, but it &oshould&r provide a
better experience, as well as give us potential data for bug
hunting, at least until next week, when filters will be
editable.
Part 3/3 will be an anti-progression-skip mechanic, hiding items
that you should not have access to without the market.
