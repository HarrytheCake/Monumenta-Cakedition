&bHotfix:&r
• Readded shaman to class selection gui
• Fixed instance bots being too verbose
• Fixed RP background not displaying if you had no class
selected in class selection gui
&bHotfix:&r Disabled respawn spectator in Corridors&nCleric:&r
• Divine Justice has received a rework:
  • L1: 0% -> 15% Divine Justice Damage Multiplier
  • L2: 20% -> 30% Divine Justice Damage Multiplier
  • Divine Justice now uses the base (unscaled) damage of the
attack that applied it
  • The "Divine Justice Damage" charm stat has been renamed to
"Divine Justice Percent Damage" and adds to Divine Justice's
damage multiplier
  • Divine Justice's damage is calculated by the following
formula:
`Divine Justice Damage = (5 + Weapon Base Damage &o Melee Crit
Bonus if applicable &r (Divine Justice Damage Multiplier + Charm
Damage)) &o Magic Damage &r Class Skill Buffs &o Consumable
Buffs`
• &rDeveloper Notes: To prevent Region 1 and 2 Cleric from
underperforming, Divine Justice's damage multiplier has been
increased. These changes attempt to address several issues with
Divine Justice, including:&o
  • &rA Cleric with a good build was still outperforming all
other classes in single target damage in Region 3 due to Divine
Justice and its charms. Charm stacking is still useful but less
potent after this change&o
  • &rSince Divine Justice applied the effects of
Attack/Projectile Damage twice, it was a suboptimal choice to
build for Magic Damage in melee-centric playstyles&o
  • &rDivine Justice's damage formula was confusing/not
intuitive&o
  • &rSplit-type Attack/Magic Damage gear will perform better on
Cleric with this change since Attack Damage contributes less to
total melee damage and Magic Damage helps compensate for DJ's
lower base damage&o
• Hallowed Beam : Significantly improved particles and targeting
• Sanctified Armor : Fixed the enhancement applying its effects
on a Thorns kill
&nWarlock:&r
• Dark Pact :
  • L1: +35% -> +50% Melee Damage
  • L2: +55% -> +75% Melee Damage
• Judgement Chain :
  • L1: +10% -> +15% damage to chained mobs
  • L2 +20% -> +30% damage to chained mobs
### Item Changes:

&b(10.56.0)&r
For the update on October 3, 2024
### Major New Features:
• As bells resonate throughout the Ring, a derelict seventh rots
upon its precipice, yearning to be rung once more.
### Minor New Features:
• Added 5 new cosmetic skills for Shaman to the existing
cosmetic skill shops:
  • Darkest Depths: Chroma Cascade (Earthen Tremor)
  • Delves: Haunted Scarecrow (Flame Totem)
  • Challenge Delves: Prestigious Totem (Whirlwind Totem) and
Prestigious Devastation (Devastation)
  • Sanguine Halls: Summoning Rite (Totemic Projection)
  • &rDeveloper Note: Some of these skills will be seeing
mechanical changes in the near future, which means the cosmetics
will have to be changed. The concepts of the cosmetics will
remain the same, but you should be aware when buying these that
they will not all stay the exact same.&o
### Loot Changes:
• Tier 3 and Tier 4 Bounties in the Celsian Isles now drop 2
Gleaming Seashells
  • &rDeveloper Note: Tier 3 and Tier 4 bounties account for
~25% of all Celsian Isles POIs. This change allows players to
obtain Gleaming Seashells at a comparable rate as Royal Crystals
from Double Bounty Weekends in the King's Valley and Godtree
Carvings from Delved bounties in the Architect's Ring.&o
### Class Changes:
&nMage:&r
• Astral Omen L2 : 7 -> 7.5 Magic Damage
• Cosmic Moonblade L2 : Additionally, if a mob is killed by this
skill, reduce all cooldowns by 7.5% (capped at 0.75s). This
effect can only be triggered once per activation.

damage output after the Additive Rework. Please read the Item

Quickdraw Cooldown, -10% -> -15% Quickdraw Damage
  • &rDeveloper Note: Bloodhound's Crest was the most-run charm
across all players in Region 3 for several months since it
allowed Rangers to apply consistent high DPS from a distance and
eschew normal attacks with bows, tridents, and crossbows that
are balanced around their respective charge times. Previously,
Bloodhound's Crest offered a 16% increase in Quickdraw DPS per
charm power. This new version offers a 9.6% increase. The new
stats are intended to make it a good option for fast cooldown
playstyles but with appropriate downsides.&o
