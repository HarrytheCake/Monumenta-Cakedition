&bHotfix:&r
Fixed a bug with swapping sets in armory deleting items with no
lore
&bHotfix&r (on daily restart):
• Disabled Tricky Creepers in Silver Knight Remnants to prevent
instance softlock issues
&bHotfix:&r
Silver Knight's Tomb has been reopened.
&bHotfix&r:
• Guilds who don't already have a guild plot can &oactually&r
select non-default types now
&bHotfixes:&r
• Fix lag caused by placing/breaking torches in places with high
amounts of tile entities
• Guilds can no longer add players to their guild as guests
without using an invite
• When buying a guild plot, other guild members are ejected from
the purchase screen to prevent being charged twice
• There is now a limit on how many unanswered invites a guild
can have open at once. Use `/guild invite <player> uninvite` to
remove old invites### Mini-Balance Update #2
• Divine Justice healing has been reworked:
  • `Whenever you kill a Heretic, you and players within 12
blocks of you regenerate 5% of their max health over 1 second.
Duration stacks on kill up to 3 seconds.`
  • &oWe're trying a different approach to DJ healing this week
that should handle some issues better than the last change.
Healing no longer requires you to have triggered Divine Justice
on the mob in the last 1.5 seconds, which was done to detach the
healing from mob density and reduce caster builds' healing
power, but would sometimes make using abilities feel bad as
you'd be missing out on healing. Now it's a regenerative effect
that stacks in duration, meaning you no longer lose out on
healing from killing with abilities, but of course it's no
longer instant. For Seraph, this means you can now heal from DJ
during Ascension. The 3 second duration ceiling exists to limit
the healing you can gain from killing large amounts of mobs at
once while not making fast killing go entirely to waste.&r
• Heavenly Boon Enhancement: 0.75s -> 1s cooldown reduction cap
• Keeper Virtue now heals targeted players at least 5 times
before stopping at the upper threshold
  • &oKeeper Virtue is looking to receive large
changes/potentially a rework in the future, likely won't get
many changes before then.&r
• Luminous Infusion: 20s -> 18s cooldown
• Malignant Neuron: +6 -> +10 Ethereal Ascension Max Duration
