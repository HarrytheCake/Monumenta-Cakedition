• Lightbringer : 8 -> 6 Attack Damage, 1.1 -> 1 Attack Speed
  • &oDeveloper Note: Lightbringer is both a melee and
projectile damage trident. With the proper set of gear and
skills (either by running Cleric or Melee Scout), Lightbringer
was able to substantially outclass Corrupted Watcher's Sword in
what should be CWatcher's niche of undead melee DPS. These
changes leave its strong projectile capabilities alone while
making it less potent as a melee undead weapon.&r
• Ashes of Eternity has received a partial rework:
 • &oApplies the effect of Resurrection upon death while holding
in mainhand. When a player triggers this effect, the enchant is
marked as \"Used\" and becomes unusable to them until the next
new day. The enchant is refreshed and mark is removed when
clicking with the item in mainhand, if a new day has occurred
since last use.&r
&bClass Changes:&r
• Divine Justice: Level 2 damage decreased from 5 + 25% damage
to 5 + 20% damage. Enhancement decreased from 5% damage per

instead of every 0.5 seconds.
• Glorious Battle: Pierce damage now only hits the first 3 mobs
you collide with while charging.
• Cloak and Dagger : Damage from this skill no longer counts
towards its boss damage thresholds for cloak stack gain
• Sharpshooter : Due to a bug we did not catch until after the
release of Additive, Sharpshooter's 25% base and 4% projectile
damage per stack were not updated to 30% and 5%, respectively as
listed in the changelogs. After allowing the changes to settle
for a few weeks, we have decided to keep the current values in
place
&bHotfix:&r It should once again be possible to unshatter items
whose base item cannot be damaged
&bMob Changes:&r
• The damage from going out of bounds in Varcosa's Black Mist
arena (being too high or too low) has changed. Each damage tick
deals significantly more damage, applies anti-heal, and damage
ticks happen less frequently. Additionally, a bug with the
damage's knockback/acceleration effects has been fixed
• Bosses and mobs that block break have received additional
under the hood improvements to reduce the differences between
block break implementations and address edge cases

further back to allow better spectating

out of the water

segment of Clear as Glass has been halved

Bottles. As a side effect, Lightning Bottles won’t show their
count in the item stack until we fully migrate them to the same
system that Alchemist Potions use

better clarify its scaling

with launch pads in Skyhigh Bora
• Removed an outdated function from completing the White Wool
dungeon that would tell players they had just unlocked the
Global channel
• Fixed some non-mob entities counting as mob kills on death,
such as the Unstable Amalgam slime or the body parts of worm
mobs. This means that e.g. ability entities like Amalgam will no
longer buff vengeful mobs, and worm mobs only count as one kill
instead of several for Vicious Combos.
• Updated the intra-Sierhaven teleporters

bonus
