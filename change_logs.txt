## Sweeping Edge Changes:
• Sweeping Edge will now trigger on any fully-charged, non-
critical hit
_Dev Note: Sweeping Edge has historically been a weak AoE
enchantment due to its awkward trigger conditions, not even
working underwater. The changes to hitbox and trigger conditions
should make it much more intuitive to use._
• Sweeping Edge and Arcane Thrust will now transfer Aspects
_Dev Note: Aspect transfer will make aspects slightly more
relevant on these items. ||Judgement of the Voidstained|| in
particular will transfer its Decay quite well._
• Sweeping Edge damage transfer has been changed to 20% per
level
_Dev Note: With the increased power of the enchantment, we want
to be able to fine-tune its power, especially in R1 where the
AoE is fairly powerful._
• The hitbox of Sweeping Edge no longer requires the mob to be
within 3 blocks

## Defensive Situational Enchant Changes:
• The Situational scaling cap in R3 has been raised from 30 to
36
 • &oALL Defensive Situationals have a new damage resistance
formula, they now provide enough Armor or Agility to provide 20%
/ 25% / 30% Effective Health, scaling linearly up to (R1) 20 /
(R2) 30 / (R3) 36 Armor / Agility. &r
&oOverall, these changes won't impact Region 1, but will largely
impact Region 2, and slightly impact Region 3, making builds
that rely on many of them at once considerably weaker. As such,
many of the items with defensive situationals have been buffed
as listed below, as well as changes to some of the situational
enchants themselves.&r
• Tempo : Halved effectivity moved from 2s to 2.5s.
  • &oDeveloper Note : A small nerf to Tempo to hit its
consistency when paired with Ethereal. Items with Tempo have
generally received some small buffs to compensate.&r
• Inure : Half effectivity clause removed.
   • &oDeveloper Note : Items with Inure have generally been
buffed to compensate for this change.&r• Guard : ADDITIONAL
TRIGGER: Activates for 4s when being hit by heavy attacks (35%
HP or more).
  • &oDeveloper Note : This additional activation condition
should help make Guard more reliable even without a shield, and
better on those that already used them.&r
• Reflexes (Rework) :  Gain 20%/25%/30% Effective Health as
Agility after damaging enemies for 0.65s. Damage over Time (DoT)
abilities and enchants do not trigger Reflexes.
  • &oDeveloper Note: This is a considerable change to Reflexes,
meaning all reflexes items in the game have been re-evaluated,
and either buffed/changed into more fitting stats.&r
• Cloaked : ADDITIONAL TRIGGERS: Half of the bonus is granted if
there are 3 or fewer enemies. Cloaked also activates for 6s
after killing an Elite or Boss mob.
  • &oDeveloper Note: The goal here is to make the enchant more
viable for general clearing without pairing it with old
Reflexes.&r
