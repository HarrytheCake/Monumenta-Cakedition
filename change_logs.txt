For the update on May 7, 2025
### Feedback Fixes
• Some blocks unaffected by the big mirror in Light Gray's Lobby
now follow the laws of reflection
• The entrance to the mini puzzle in Toxic Den has been given
some gravel to make it easier to find
• Moved the respawn location in ||The Grand Forgeway|| out of
the portal

room.

### Twisted Changes
• The Twisted modifier has been partially reworked:
  • The two levels have been changed to two modifiers with five
levels each, Twisted and Tormented. The first modifier is nearly
the exact same as what Twisted was before its rework, and the
second, Tormented, has all the enhanced twisteds, granting twice
the delve points and having a higher spawn rate per level.
  • Twisted and Tormented cannot be used together • there is a
special interaction on the Twisted modifier icon that turns it
into Tormented and vice versa.
  • Challenge Delve presets have all been reverted to the same
state as before the initial rework, with Twisted 5. May be
revisited in the future for Tormented usage.
• Added a new special drop from Enhanced Twisteds
• Twisted Gravecaller: 1600 -> 1350 Health, Gravesoul Haunter
now stands still while Grasping Claws is casting
• Reworked Twisted Vanguard's Colossal Force to be less
obtrusive## May Balance Update
### Enchantment Changes
• Retaliation:
  • Debuff effects have been categorized into 3 groups, instead
of having a unique effect for most debuffs. Can now only be
applied from basic melee and projectile attacks.
  • The damage bonus has been changed to Gear Damage and
rebalanced, and the once-per-tick cap has been removed. The
description is now: `After blocking damage, gain a damage bonus
for 4s based on the type of enemy blocked (35%/50%/65% for
normal/elite/boss, halved when dealing magic/projectile damage).
Certain blocked debuffs will infuse the first basic
melee/projectile attack in this period with an effect
corresponding to the blocked debuffs.`
