&bDue to a critical-severity bug, the server has been put into
maintenance mode.&r
Please watch <#579190910567317514> for further updates.
&bHotfix (when server is back up):&r Reynart will no longer have
no dialogue when you are trying to finish Assisted Dreaming if
you are currently in an in-progress state for External
Corruption
&bAll world bosses have been temporarily closed.&r
Since the bossfights cause network lag for all online players,
the bosses are unavailable until the stability of the server
improves to pre-migration levels.Eldrask has been reopened on
the isles shard.Public github repo at
<https://github.com/TeamMonumenta/monumenta-plugins-public> has
been updated with code up through the most recent update.Due to
the switch in the URL for the main gameplay build calculator
ohthemisery.vercel.app from a .tk website to a .vercel.app
website, I have posted new links to every <#1165742923510468618>
post in the replies of that thread with the new link. Please
ping me over in <#575516687676211215> with a link to the thread
that needs fixing if something is incorrect, this was admittedly
done very fast and with limited validations as I went. I will
get to any reported when i can, but hopefully a large majority
of them are working fine now.
