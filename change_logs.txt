&bHotfix:&r Voyage of Discovery now properly sends you to Isles
during its progression
&bHotfix:&r Updated the respawning barrel of signs in the player
market to include all of the new sign typesPublic plugin repo
has been updated https://github.com/TeamMonumenta/monumenta-
plugins-public
&bHotfix:&r Upgraded every map item file; Purple and all the
other dungeons will no longer kick you or crash anything for
picking up maps. Some maps on Valley may still have dummy data
from the temporary fix earlier, but that will fix itself with
weekly update. If the map item you're holding has dummy data on
it, it's safe to hold onto it • it will be updated at that
time.[Original Message Deleted]### (11.2.0)
