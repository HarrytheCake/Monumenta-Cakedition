&bHotfix:&r
• Fixed Tier 13 of the Pass of Dissonance rewards track (the
Gaze of Winter dummy) giving absolutely nothing.
-# &oPlayers who have already reached this tier of the Seasonal
Pass before this hotfix (and therefore, didn't get the dummy)
can reach out in moderator-help to have the dummy egg given to
them.
&b&r(11.42.0)&r
For the update on November 5, 2025
• The Creeperween event has ended for this year • this time
around, at the correct moment! Creepers will no longer accept
Tricky Candies from players. Creeper Fanatic Boris will still
offer his quest and trades. Additionally, Sierhaven and the
Sierhaven Apartments have returned to their original form. You
know, maybe turning an apartment building into a pop-up store
wasn't a great idea, anyways…

creation of a new item grave. You will receive a warning for the
7th or higher item grave of this impending action.
• Completing the Celsian Isles Monument now offers an additional
upgrade to selling station conversion rates! By completing both
Monuments, selling stations will now offer rates equivalent to
that of the Perfect Crystalizer
• The Halloween Spirit has been exorcised from Sierhaven

### &n Bleeding Changes &r
&oWith the additional time we've had due to the delays, we've
looked more closely at last balance's items, as well as items
affected by the bleeding rework and adjusted them accordingly.
Additionally, the enchant itself is being tweaked to allow us to
be more flexible with the designs that utilize it in the
future!&r
• The amount of stacks required to hemorrhage enemies is
increased to 8 stacks (from 5) for non-boss enemies.

non-bosses and bosses respectively:
