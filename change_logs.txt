to modern day lore

for your convenience. They are also available at the dye trader
elsewhere in Sierhaven.

any player triggers Rebirth

• Fixed the Parrot GUI not showing the date that a parrot was
bought immediately after buying it until the GUI is reopened

Rainbow Parrot if one of the required parrots was bought until
the GUI is reopened
• Enmity Sentry is now correctly under Exalted Reverie in the
Bestiary
• Updated the Kaul's Warden interaction in Reverie and Exalted
Reverie. It is now tied to the instance rather than to the
player, so those who were not present when it was completed can
still access the trades. It will also no longer break if you
start it but don't finish it in one week
• Fixed opening a Wildcard room in Zenith deleting the block
that the player is standing inside of
• Fixed Brutal Thug not being elite

update. In order to unlock your shop talk to the shop shulker
and select `I want to unlock this shop`.
• The City of Shifting Waters is still bugged. Players are
advised to complete the dungeon in a single sitting to avoid
instance corruption.The City of Shifting Waters has been closed.

at the new death location (if able), and deletes the previous
grave.
• Added a new epic cosmetic skill set for Warlock, which can be
acquired from a certain NPC after conquering a jungle's
nightmare.
• We are experimenting with a few changes to musical elite
finishers, using Poultrification as a starting point. While this
finisher is playing, any kills during the currently playing part
will continue to play in harmony. No other finishers will be
randomly selected until all parts of the current song have
finished. We plan to update the other musical finishers as time
permits, so that only one song will play at a time for a given
player's kills.
• Lore entries have been added for the Light Blue dungeon mobs
in the Bestiary
&bFeedback Fixes:&r
• Spring Loaded Sheath now displays +4 Dagger Throw Daggers

C'Telsket's Memory after completion of A Study in Crimson Part 1
