â€¢ &oThe ability relied on certain overtuned charms in R3 to deal
significant damage. The new rework aims to make Beam much better
on its own, reducing the need for high damage boosting charms.&r
  â€¢ &oThe gap in strength between L1 and L2 was too vast. It had
2/3 charges and 16s/12s cooldown per charge at L1/L2
respectively, which has been buffed to 3 charges and 10s
cooldown at both levels. The L2 has been replaced by a primed
AoE effect to give the spec some more consistent on-demand AoE
via added skill expression. The higher consistency also plays
into the addition of the following skill:&r
&nKeeper Virtue (NEW â€¢ Replacing Thurible Procession)&r:
&oAn angelic spirit follows you, supporting nearby players and
attacking Heretics but losing health in the process.&r
â€¢ L1: Passively have a Virtue with 30 health follow you, and
while inactive it regenerates 1 health every 0.5s and grants you
15% speed. It can be healed by Hallowed Beam at any time. <Swap
while not sneaking> to toggle it active, making it seek out
players within 16 blocks under 60% health, healing them for 5%
of their max health every 0.5s until they're up to 70% or
higher, draining 2 health per heal. If there are no players to
heal, it instead seeks out Heretics, dealing R2: 6 / R3: 8 magic
damage to them and draining 2 health every 1.25s. The Virtue
regenerates half as much while active and without a target. If
the Virtue dies, it respawns after 20s.
â€¢ L2: The Virtue now has 35 health. The speed bonus when
inactive is now granted to all players in a 9 block radius
around you. Mobs attacked by the Virtue are inflicted with 15%
vulnerability for 4s.

â€¢ &rAs a mini-roadmap for the next future balance update(s),
development on the Berserker rework will resume, and we will
begin directing more attention over to Warlock as well. There
are no more large-scale Cleric plans for now, we didn't get to
do Cleansing Rain changes like mentioned last month but may pick
up on that in the near future.&o### Enchantments:
â€¢ Reflexes now grants half the agility bonus for 0.35s after the
initial 0.65s.
â€¢ Guard now is only active for 2s when activated by its
secondary health threshold condition.
### Mob Changes:

â€¢ Ru'Ten: 75k -> 60k health
  â€¢ &rThe removal of Thurible Procession has greatly lowered the
ceiling for notably melee DPS with optimized builds in R3, so
we're reducing the health values of Hexfall bosses to compensate
and hopefully make the content slightly more accessible to less
optimized groups. Health reductions to other bosses have been
deemed unnecessary but may be reevaluated later.&o
