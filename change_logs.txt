&nRogue Charms:&r
• Masked's Black Knife : 2 -> 1 Charm Power, +8 -> +6 Cloak and
Dagger Max Stacks
• Nalatia's Sigil : 4 -> 3 Charm Power
• Bloodborne Locket : 2 -> 3 Charm Power, 0 -> -15% By My Blade
Damage, 0 -> -15% By My Blade Cooldown
  • &oDeveloper Note : This charm failed to perform well in the
niche it provided and was inconsistent. The new stats are
intended to improve the rate and consistency of healing from By
My Blade's enhancement.&r
&nAlchemist Charms:&r
• Toxic Steroid : +10% -> +25% Taboo Damage Modifier
• Resonating Belltongue : +30% -> +150% Alchemical Artillery

&nScout Charms:&r
• Bloodhound's Crest : 5 -> 3 Charm Power, -50% -> -33%
Quickdraw Cooldown, -10% -> -15% Quickdraw Damage
  • &oDeveloper Note: Bloodhound's Crest was the most-run charm
across all players in Region 3 for several months since it
allowed Rangers to apply consistent high DPS from a distance and
eschew normal attacks with bows, tridents, and crossbows that
are balanced around their respective charge times. Previously,
Bloodhound's Crest offered a 16% increase in Quickdraw DPS per
charm power. This new version offers a 9.6% increase. The new
stats are intended to make it a good option for fast cooldown
playstyles but with appropriate downsides.&r

&bImportant:&r

update. In order to unlock your shop talk to the shop shulker
and select `I want to unlock this shop`.
• The City of Shifting Waters is still bugged. Players are
advised to complete the dungeon in a single sitting to avoid
instance corruption.
&bHotfix&r (was done so last daily restart but I forgot to
post):
• Tier 3 and 4 Celsian Isles bounty chests have had their chance
to drop an additional Gleaming Seashell adjusted to 33% and 66%,
respectively. Additionally, the Seer will award new chests that
use these updated chances while old chests have been reverted to
only drop one Seashell.
  • &oDeveloper Note: I severely underestimated the amount of
tier 3 and tier 4 bounties that a player could expect to
encounter when rolling for daily bounties. To prevent the market
from being flooded with Seashells, this bug fix was pushed as a
hotfix. I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused.
&b&r(10.57.0)&r
For the update on October 10, 2024
### Major New Features:

paranoia.||
• Experimental delve modifiers are back for the second time
during this week, starting on weekly reset
• To celebrate the spooky season, Haunted has been guaranteed •
with a new, special level 2 of the modifier
• Watch your back, and don't be afraid of ghosts…
### Minor New Features:

has been themed around the Dungeon itself to improve immersion
and give the player a taste of what awaits them inside.

listings

Divine Justice:
• Divine Justice has received additional changes to address
issues added with the previous update:
  • The Divine Justice Percent Damage charm stat has been made
additive with Divine Justice's damage multiplier again
  • The effects of Divine Justice can only be applied to the
same mob once every 10 ticks, but higher damage Divine Justice
hits will add additional damage
    • &oDeveloper Note: Divine Justice is unique in that it is a
melee/projectile skill that applies magic damage. This means it
originally ignored invulnerability ticks mobs receive when
taking damage. Due to the way different damage types are
balanced, this led to situations where it was optimal to stack
multiple Clerics for single target damage in multiplayer which
runs contrary to all other class stacking strategies that suffer
heavily from diminishing returns. Since Divine Justice now uses
the same timing for invulnerability ticks as melee and
projectiles, this specific change will have little to no effect
on solo players' damage output.&r
  • Lesser Smiting Charm : +10% -> +5% Divine Justice Percent
Damage
  • Greater Smiting Charm : +20% -> +10% Divine Justice Percent
Damage
  • Focused Smiting Charm : +35% -> +15% Divine Justice Percent

Justice Ally Heal
  • Bloodpact Pendant : +30% -> 20% Divine Justice Percent
Damage, -30% -> -50% Divine Justice Self Heal
• &oDeveloper Note: It is known that these changes along with
last week's patch have greatly decreased Cleric's damage output.
We were planning to ship more changes to address this but due to
time constraints it wasn't possible to implement and test them
thoroughly. There will be more changes to address this issue
next balance patch.&r• Standard Infusions and Delve Infusions
refund 100% of the cost for this week
