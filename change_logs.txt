&bHotfix:&r The Virius fight in Clear as Glass now properly
starts
&bHotfix:&r An issue with dungeon races has been resolved
&bHotfix:&r Holding an invalid map (such as given by a quest) no
longer causes shards to crash • because I removed all of them
and temporarily replaced them with another randomly chosen
known-good map. This means many maps given by quests, etc. will
probably just be wrong, possibly misleadingly so. The map will
show some random other picture • but the item itself is fine,
you can keep it and it'll work right and show the correct image
when the bug is fixed, hopefully the next update or two.
&bHotfix:&r The <coords> chat inline command is now usable.###

For the update on January 30, 2025
### Major New Features:
&bQuest Progression Resetting:&r
A new NPC has arrived in the Sierhaven Academy, Hans, who will
offer the player a new reset ability. Through him, players can
now opt to reset their entire quest progression from the ground-
up, without having to scratch other play data/progression.
Utilizing's Hans offer, the following will occur:
• All quest progress will be reset back to zero (the only
exception being Halid's Song)
• All quest-related advancements will be wiped
• Uniques and other rewards can be obtained via quest re-
completions
• No dungeon progression, instances, skill points, inventory,
plots, or other data will be affected by the reset
Further details can be found in game! As an additional security
measure, Hans will also allow the option to never offer this
service again, should you be convinced that you never want to
risk it occurring to your account.
### Minor New Features:
• Cryospheres are now considered an event currency
• The Season Pass Hub music now plays in your ears instead of
from some point above your head

• Added a missing discovery to Eastern Pass

• Updated Team Monumenta, moderators, and top patrons on the
website
