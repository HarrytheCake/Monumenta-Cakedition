‚Ä¢ Nightpyre Chains : +25% -> +35% Magic Damage, 2 -> 3 Fire
Protection, 2 -> 0 Inferno
 &o‚Ä¢ Developer Note : This item was weighted much lower than it
should have been, and with its general lack of usage, additional
points have been added to its magic damage to offset the penalty
of its Ineptitude.&r
‚Ä¢ Frostguard Sabatons (Rework) : 6 Armor, Magic Protection 2,
+15% Attack Damage, -10% Speed, +2 Knockback Resistance
‚Ä¢ Winter‚Äôs March : 0 -> 1 Stamina, 0% -> +10% Attack Speed, 6.5

2 Blast Protection

‚Ä¢ Boots of Alutana (Boots of Monshee) : 0 -> 2 First Strike, +8%
-> 0% Projectile Damage, 7 -> 6.5 Armor
 &o‚Ä¢ Developer Note : Boots of Alutana have been changed for a
similar reason to Mask of the Interim, to open its niche to
melee as well as maintaining its projectile viability.&r
‚Ä¢ Nightsky Treads : 9 -> 8 Agility
 &o‚Ä¢ Developer Note : This item was weighted too high, leaving
it with stats similar to an Artifact..&r# Celsian Isles Offhand
Items üìú
‚Ä¢ Blackthread Whip (Rework) : Melee Protection 3, Blast
Protection 3, Technique 3, 4.5 Agility, +10% Speed
 &o‚Ä¢ Developer Note : The previous version of this item was
stretched too thin trying to fulfill multiple different niches
at once, so it‚Äôs getting a full rework to help diversify it from
the competition.&r
‚Ä¢ Dissonant Dagger : +55% -> +45% Attack Damage
 &o‚Ä¢ Developer Note : Dissonant Dagger was incorrectly weighted
as higher than it should have been as a Pink rare, so this will
make it have the budget it was supposed to.&r
‚Ä¢ Celsian Sarissa (Rework) : First Strike 2, 6 Armor, +15%
Attack Damage, 3 Knockback Resistance
‚Ä¢ Chime of the Requiem (Rework) : Shielding 1, Second Wind 2,
Triage 2, 3.5 Armor, +20% Attack Speed
 &o‚Ä¢ Developer Note : Chime previously lost out to offhand
shields/defensive offhands due to its lower defensive stats and
attack damage, so it‚Äôs turning into attack speed and gaining
defense to lessen the burden when building slower scythes.&r
‚Ä¢  Rites of Eternity : 0 -> 1 Aptitude, 1 -> 2 Regeneration
‚Ä¢ Firefly‚Äôs Rush : 0 -> 1 Ethereal, 6 -> 5.5 Agility, 1 -> 0
Evasion
 &o‚Ä¢ Developer Note : Firefly‚Äôs Rush‚Äôs situational enchantment
had negative synergy with its other stats, so it‚Äôs getting
changed into Ethereal to help it perform better in its niche.&r
‚Ä¢ Passing Shadows : 0 -> 1 Technique, 0 -> 2 Agility, +42% ->
+20% Attack Damage, +10% -> 0% Speed
 &o‚Ä¢ Developer Note : This change should help builds acquire the
agility they need to reach the situational scaling cap more
easily, while not compromising completely on its offensive
traits.&r
‚Ä¢ Water‚Äôs Embrace (Rework) : Abyssal 1, Gills, Sustenance 2, 6
Agility, +15% Magic Damage
 &o‚Ä¢ Developer Note : The previous version of this item was
unable to fulfill any meaningful niche above land or under the
sea, so it‚Äôs becoming something hopefully more appealing to
both.&r# Patron Items üí∞
‚Ä¢ Frigid Rupture : 20.5 -> 22 Projectile Damage
‚Ä¢ Plaguebaron‚Äôs Scythe : 5 -> 7 Attack Damage, 0 -> 1 Thunder

‚Ä¢ Iron Pipe : 7 -> 12.5 Attack Damage, 2 -> 1.2 Attack Speed
‚Ä¢ Memory Maker : 6 -> 9 Projectile Damage 0 -> 1 Piercing
 &o‚Ä¢ Developer Note : Memory Maker‚Äôs item niche existed
previously as a catalyst for Alchemical Artillery, a skill that
no longer exists, leaving the item very underwhelming.&r
# Architect‚Äôs Ring Charms üìø
&o‚Ä¢ Developer Note : Following the release of Touch of Radiance,
many cooldown reducing charms are getting their stats reduced to
accommodate for the increased uptime.&r
‚Ä¢ Starstrike Emblem (Rework): 3 Charm Power, +0.5 Touch of

Life Drain 1, 19 Attack Damage, 1 Attack Speed, +80% Spell Power
# Architect‚Äôs Ring Armor ü¶∫
&o‚Ä¢ Developer Note : As Inferno has been much reduced in power,
and Triage‚Äôs usefulness overstated, we‚Äôve reduced the cost these
enchants take on certain items, as well as moving some of their
niches away into more usable items.&r
‚Ä¢ Shattered Crown (Rework): Inferno 3, Regicide 1, Stamina 1,

&bClass Changes&r ‚öôÔ∏è
&o‚Ä¢ Developer Note: Crusade was always a must-pick skill for
Cleric as a whole, and was sapping 2 skill points from being
used on other skills. As such we're moving it into the base
class and replacing it with a utility skill that provides CDR to
you and your allies. As a mini-roadmap for the next balance
update(s), we will continue to look at Cleric with focus on
especially Divine Justice, improving its damage formula and
combating its charm dependency, and Luminous Infusion,
addressing its inconsistency and charm dependency as well.&r
‚Ä¢
&bCleric:&r
  ‚Ä¢ Rejuvenation has been changed to Hierophant's specialization
passive
  ‚Ä¢ Crusade has become the new Cleric passive. Description:
`Human-like enemies are treated as Undead by your abilities.
After being damaged or debuffed by an ability, any mob will
count as Undead by your abilities for the next 10 seconds.`
  ‚Ä¢ The ability slot Crusade previously occupied has been
replaced by a new ability,
&bTouch of Radiance&r:
    ‚Ä¢ L1: `<Trigger> while looking at another player or an
Undead mob within 16 blocks to gain 35% faster cooldown recharge
rate for all other abilities and 50% knockback resistance for 7
seconds. If looking at a player, the player gains the same
buffs. If looking at an Undead, it is stunned for 1.5 seconds.
Players are prioritized when searching for a target. Cooldown:
24s.`
    ‚Ä¢ L2: `Cooldown recharge rate is increased to 50%.
Additionally, all mobs within a 3.5 block radius of the target
are inflicted with 20% weakness for 7 seconds.`
    ‚Ä¢ Enhancement: `After killing the targeted mob, your next
attack on an Undead deals 9 magic damage to it and stuns it for
0.5s. That mob becomes the new target, and killing it grants the
same effect, repeating until Touch of Radiance runs out. If the
original target was a player, the effect is primed for both of
you immediately.`‚Ä¢ Cleansing Rain has been partially reworked:
    ‚Ä¢ L1: `<Trigger> to summon a Cleansing Rain that follows
you, removing all negative effects shorter than 30 seconds from
players within 4 blocks, including yourself, and lasts for 6
seconds. Players heal 10% of their max health the first time a
given debuff is cleansed, up to 3 unique debuffs. Cooldown:
25s.`
    ‚Ä¢ L2: `Additionally grants 20% Resistance to affected
players. Duration is increased to 10 seconds.`
    ‚Ä¢ Enhancement: `The radius increases to 6 blocks, and each
player touched by the rain keeps its effect for the cast
duration.`
‚Ä¢
&bMage:&r
&o‚Ä¢ Developer Note: Spellshock's enhancement paired with the
high octane spell casting of Arcanist builds ended up being
stronger than we anticipated, so we're toning it back to more
reasonable levels.&r
  ‚Ä¢ Spellshock Enhancement:
   ` ‚Ä¢ 15% -> 10% vulnerability from Ice Spellshock triggers
 ‚Ä¢ 3 -> 1.5 DoT from Arcane Spellshock triggers
 ‚Ä¢ 5 -> 4 damage from Lightning Spellshock triggers`
‚Ä¢
&bScout:&r
&o‚Ä¢ Developer Note: A lot of Rending Razor's strength in R3 was
helped out by charms, leaving it inflexible and very polarizing
when building, and didn't fare so well in R2, so it's receiving
a base buff and getting its charms nerfed/reworked.&r
‚Ä¢ Rending Razor:
` ‚Ä¢ Cooldown changed from 8s/6s -> 6s/4s.
  ‚Ä¢ Embed damage changed from 12/16 -> 16/20
  ‚Ä¢ Rend damage changed from 16/22 -> 20/26`
  ‚Ä¢ Sharpshooter:
`‚Ä¢ L1: Now gives up to 4 sharpshooter stacks. 20% -> 15%
Projectile Damage bonus
 ‚Ä¢ L2: 15% -> 20% Projectile Damage bonus`
