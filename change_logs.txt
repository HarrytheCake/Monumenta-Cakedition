&b(11.6.0)&r

### Minor New Features:
• Added a new cosmetic skill set for Mage, which can be acquired
from a certain NPC after liberating the seasons and conquering
the source of their affliction.
• A new Galos themed SKR puzzle had been added!
• Added advancements for new spawner types that were introduced
with the release of Silver Knight Remnants
• Worldshaper's Loom now has an additional mode that
automatically changes mode based on where the player is looking
• Interactable lecterns across the game (Forum, Star Point,
etc.) have been given a sound effect when receiving a book from
them
• Added Cherry Chahna to the Isles overworld
• Various changes to player plots
  • Added a standardized prefix to most messages
  • Changed the syntax of commands dealing with plot access from
`/plot access` to `/plot`
  • Suggestions of players with access to your plot now appear
when typing `/plot remove` in chat
  • Fixed not being notified when you are granted access to
someone's plot if you were not on the same shard as them
• The PEB/Player settings GUI has received a rework, and now
displays your current settings in the lore. Please report any
bugs related to unclear or inconsistent descriptions or inverted
settings.

Locust Swarm Finisher
• Quake radius now works in a sphere instead of a square
• Eldrask's Greatsword Slam : 18 -> 36 Magic Damage### SK
Remnants Changes:
&nScroll Drops:&r
• All dailies / weeklies that can drop Scrolls now have a decent
chance at dropping Scroll Fragments when a scroll fails.
• All Scroll drops are now weighted equally between Combat &
Puzzle scrolls.
   • If desired, we could look into weighing based on content
akin to augments.
• Strike & Boss daily scroll rates have been buffed slightly.
   • Nerfed portal's non-daily drop rate to account for the
possible completion speed.
   • Buffed Sirius daily by 10%, godspore daily by 15%.
   • Buffed Sirius uncommon by 15%, godspore uncommon by 10%
• Fishing dailies (Five greater/abyssal caches) can now drop
Scrolls and Scroll Fragments
• Bounties are now weighed equally across tiers.
   • It was weird that this was the only obtainment method that
scaled with delves, functionally excluding newer players
• Poi pinatas (end chests) can now drop scroll fragments rarely.
   • This chance scales with players.
   • This chance is weighted based on the same criteria for
scroll chances, explained here: https://discord.com/channels/313
066655494438922/1345340298527637566/1346178292998213773
   • Chance for scrolls from endchests remains the same.
• Bonus scroll from clearing 19 pois has been reduced to
&b12&r.
   • Instead of 7 days to do 3 biomes worth, you have 7 days to
do 2 biomes worth.
   • The chat message is also green now.&nRemnant Caches:&r
• Have been reworked, now have a significantly buffed rare drop
chance but cost
&b9&r memory fragments, previously 6.
• In tandem with additional Scroll & Scroll Fragment drops being
added, caches will spew out less raw har value in currencies.
Dropped har still remains at  3 • 4.
• Removed sequence scrolls as a possible drop from caches. While
the dopamine chase was fun, the variance caused in large part by
this drop was allowing for dubious scroll loops.
• +1 scroll fragment when a scroll doesn't drop from a cache. (1
to 2) -> (2 to 3)
• Replaced the augment potion drops with strong potion drops
&nRecord Keeper Trades&r:
• Reduced the fragment cost of basic scrolls, from 10 -> 8. Har
cost increased from 1 -> 2.
• Sequence scroll remain at 12 fragment cost.
   • Aim here is to allow sequences to an option of preference,
however due to room chest variance they'll still be a wee bit
better on average.
• Reduced Rare trade frag costs by 33% (24 -> 16 Memory
Fragments)
   • Overall the direct rare trade aims to be the main reliable
source of rares
&nRoom Changes:&r
• Fixed a few rooms having less chests than intended.
• Galos waters are now shark infested
• Normal Combat and Puzzle rooms now at minimum have 6 chests.
  • Overall combats and puzzles are closer in average value to
each other.
• Better standardized Puzzle room rewards to have less variance
• Long Combat room rewards have been better standardized
   • In practice this means we shot a single outlying room with
too many chests that was causing me headaches
   • Increased chest count in a couple under chested Long
Combats
• The actionbar now displays total chest count in a given room.
• A name's room is now displayed on the initial entry in a
subtitle.
• The Minesweeper puzzle has been given a new room and is now
part of the Wolfswood biome.&nGeneral Changes:&r
• Mobs are now in the bestiary. Massive shout-out to Wembler for
taking on this tedious task.
• SKR items are now on the Item API.
     • They are not in the mog pool yet, check back in a month.
• Reduced some annoying glow lichen that could block melee
attacks.
• Dev, Room Contributor, and Beta Tester credits are now added
to the tree behind the Record Keeper.
• Crying Obsidian which mark entrance locations can no longer be
mined.
• The Portable Gatecharm now notifies the player upon
unsuccessfully trying to put Rare, Epic, and Zenith charms into
it.
• Fixed a lore book referencing a location from an earlier
draft.
&nFeedback&r
The vast majority of these changes are in direct response to the
comments over in the feedback thread: https://discord.com/channe
ls/313066655494438922/1345340298527637566
Please continue providing your input as I try to read every
message. The general aim here is for scrolls to remain as a rare
drop, primarily from weekly / daily rewards to allow access to
the more casual players. I'll be keeping an eye on overall drops
this next week to gauge how this goes. Thank you all who've
given feedback so far ❤️
