### Guild Plots Feedback and Bug Fixes:
• Added the option to control the permissions of anyone not in
your guild. This means you can let everyone visit your guild
plot, view your items, or hang out in your guild chat.
• In case you didn't &oactually&r mean &oanyone&r not in your
guild, there is now also a Blocked access level, who are never
allowed any of your guild permissions. The "kick" option is the
same as whatever your public permissions are, and Guest is for
individual members not in your guild.
• Added proper "manage membership" and "lockdown" permissions
instead of them being tied to the manager and founder access
levels.
• It is no longer possible to edit the permissions of individual
players who are invited to the guild, but who have not accepted
your invite.
• Added a cooldown on `/guild invite`.
• The white tesseract now works on guild plots
• Fixed being unable to place blocks on the barrier block floor
of Guild Plots## April Balance Update
&bEnchantment Changes&r
• Intoxicating Warmth : 15 -> 12s effect duration
  • &oDeveloper Note: This enchantment made Forgeflame Liquor
more powerful than steak consumables at Saturation stacking with
its ability to be used at any time off cooldown; other foods
require missing hunger. Its effect has been shortened to make
foods and Starvation potions more competitive in the niche.&r
• Jungle's Nourishment : 24 -> 20 Hunger
  • &oDeveloper Note: This change has no effect on the
enchantment's potency as player hunger is capped at 20 points.&r
• Rage of the Keter :
  • +6 -> +4 Hunger
  • +6 -> +4 Saturation
  • The enchantment's description has been updated to clarify
only melee, projectile, and magic damage are affected
  • &oDeveloper Note: This enchantment was providing more hunger
recovery than we anticipated when pair with other buff
consumables for what is supposed to be a go-to for damage. As a
result, dedicated hunger recovery consumables were not appealing
to many endgame players. Its food statistics have been reduced
to give hunger recovery consumables a chance to be
competitive.&r
• Regicide : Now provides the same damage buff (+10%) against
Elite and Boss enemies• Retaliation (Rework) :
  • Any mob you attack within 4s of successfully blocking damage
(max 1 mob per tick), will take increased damage from all the
damage you deal in that tick, based on the type of enemy blocked
(25% for normal, 40% for elite, 50% for boss). Certain blocked
debuffs will infuse the first attack with an effect based on
those debuffs.
  • &oDeveloper Note : The previous iteration of this
enchantment was paradoxically worse in easier content as it
scaled off of mobs' original damage without factoring in buffs.
Due to technical reasons, it wasn't possible to make Retaliation
consider the mob's damage buffs. This new damage calculation is
a compromise that still achieves the goal of damage bonus
consistency across all content, but also reduces the cases of
losing a high damage buff from continuing to block.&r
• Reverb : Killing an enemy with a Reverb projectile allows the
projectile to bounce to another enemy within range
• Temporal Bender (Rework) :
  • +100% Ability Cooldown Recharge Rate for 5s
  • +6 -> +4 Hunger
  • +6 -> +4 Saturation
  • &oDeveloper Note: Temporal Bender was a contender for one of
the strongest enchantments in the game. Its previous effect of
hard CDR drastically changed how certain classes played and
caused unintended gameplay effects in Region 1 and 2 since
consumables can be freely used in all regions. Reducing the CDR
value of the previous version was not an option as too little
CDR upon consumption would not be worth the costs of the time to
consume Mountain's Dew to gain the effect, the cooldown, and
hotbar space. To keep this new version useful it does not change
the final outcome; 5 seconds of cooldown are saved at the end of
the effect's duration on all active class abilities. We will be
listening to your feedback on this enchantment's strength in the
coming months and adjust it accordingly.
&b&rCharm Changes&r
• Lesser Brutal Charm : +25% -> 20% Brutal Alchemy DoT Damage
• Greater Brutal Charm : +50% -> 40% Brutal Alchemy DoT Damage
• Focused Brutal Charm : +75% -> 60% Brutal Alchemy DoT Damage

Amalgam Dropped Potion Damage Modifier
• Loci's Hunger : -0.3% -> -0.75% Rampage Resistance Per Stack,
0 -> -10 Rampage Damage Threshold
  • &oDeveloper Note : While the previous iteration of this
charm increased the flexibility of Berserker's skills, its
overall effect on encounters did not justify the cost of the
charm. This rework intends to make the charm lean more into high
risk, high reward Rampage usage.&r
• Pyroclastic Emesis : -50% -> -30% Starfall Fall Speed, 0 ->
+30% Starfall Radius
• Stonebearer Toxin : -25% -> 0% Iron Tincture Absorption, 0% ->
+50% Iron Tincture Stun Radius

• Urn of Perpetuity (Rework) : 1 Charm Power, +20 Blizzard
Duration, +10% Blizzard Slowness Amplifier, -35% Blizzard Range,
-200% Blizzard Damage
  • &oDeveloper Note : This charm's previous niche was difficult
to balance as passive playstyles could still deal substantial
damage with Blizzard Damage charms equipped. This reworked
version is intended to give Elementalists zoning capabilities
against melee enemies.&r
• Wolfbone Pendant : -25% -> 0% Hunting Companion Damage, +5% ->
+100% Hunting Companion Healing
&bItem Changes&r
&nKing's Valley&r
• Archmage's Femur : 9 -> 11 Attack Damage
&nCelsian Isles&r
• Blackflame Gauntlet (Infernal Gauntlet) : 1 -> 0 Poise, 0 -> 2
Melee Protection, +50% -> +55% Spell Power
&nArchitect's Ring Consumables&r
• All Hunts Potions' durations have been increased to 40 minutes
• Quicksilver Vial : 0% -> +10% Speed
• Muddied Tincture : +50% -> 75% Knockback Resistance

• Concentrated Shade Seabass : 0 -> +10% Resistance (12:30),
+40% Blast Resistance (0:30) -> +30% Blast Resistance (12:30)
• Concentrated Mechanical Monkfish : Effect durations increased
from 2:00 to 12:30
• Concentrated Forest Flounder : 0 -> +10% Max Health (12:30)

to 2:30, Poison 1 -> Poison Immunity, 60% -> 40% Speed

from 5:00 to 12:30 (except Glowing)
• Concentrated Norvigut Tuna : Removed Nausea, Poison 2 (30:00)
-> Poison 3 (12:30), 0 -> -100% Healing Rate (12:30)
• Concentrated Startouched Swordfish : Effect durations
increased from 5:00 to 12:30&nArchitect's Ring Masterwork&r
• Across the Ocean (M4) : 9.5 -> 9 Armor
• Blightblood Falchion (M4) : 19 -> 18.5 Attack Damage
  • &oDeveloper Note: This sword was out-competing other weapon
options for Rogue and Warrior. Since its base attack speed
allows it to achieve 100% critical hit uptime with the attack
speed both classes gain from abilities, its damage output has
been slightly reduced to allow other weapons to be
competitive.&r
• Caduceus (M4) : 6.5 -> 7.5 Attack Damage, 80% -> 85% Spell
Power
• Chimera's Grace (M6) : 1 -> 0 Ethereal, 0 -> 1 Guard, 3 -> 0
Technique, 0 -> 2 Magic Protection, Unbreakable -> Unbreaking 5
+ Mending
  • The shield's defensive enchants no longer work when held in
mainhand
  • &oDeveloper Note: Ethereal was initially chosen to provide
the player increased defense while their shield was disabled,
but this ended up with the unintended effect of making the
shield feel weaker in general. This iteration has Guard instead
to provide more consistent defenses overall. Additionally,
Technique was removed in favor of strengthening Retaliation (see
enchantment changes), granting the shield more versatility
across classes and playstyles that Technique did not benefit.&r
• Eclipse Stream (M4) (Rework) : 9 Agility, 20% Magic Damage,
Adaptability, Inferno 2, Unbreaking 10
• Extinction (M4) : 32 -> 30 Attack Damage, 3 -> 4 Impact, 3 ->
4 Knockback
• God Tamer (M4 only) : 82% -> 85% Spell Power, 2 -> 1 Magic
Protection• Memoria Ancestrale (M4) : 15.5 -> 16.5 Attack Damage
• Molldyer's Greatstaff (M4) : 22.5 -> 23.5 Attack Damage
• Moonscarred Clockblade (M4) : 15.5 -> 15 Attack Damage
  • &oDeveloper Note: This sword was out-competing other sword
options for Rogue by a wide margin, especially since Reverb
pairs well with Rogue's abilities. Its damage output has been
slightly reduced to allow other swords to be competitive.&r
• The Godcap (M4) : 12 -> 12.5 Attack Damage
• The Vedha's Soulcrusher (M4) : 25 -> 24 Attack Damage
  • &oDeveloper Note: This axe was out-competing other weapons
for Warrior by a wide margin. As a result, its damage buff from
the February balance update has been tuned down.&r
• Thundering Legacy (M4) : 14 -> 15.5 Attack Damage
• Veinshredder (M4) : 17.5 -> 17 Attack Damage
• Withering Hydrangea (M4) : 6.5 -> 8.5 Attack Damage, 1 -> 4
Decay, 1 -> 2 Ice Aspect
