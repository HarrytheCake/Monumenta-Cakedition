&b(11.29.0)&r
For the update on August 13, 2025
## Delve Modifier Megapack
•
&bIdolatry • Level 5 Experimental, 1pt/level&r
Spawners have a 3% chance per level to spawn a slow moving Idol.
While an enemy is within a 12 block radius of an alive Idol, 75%
of the damage it takes will instead be redirected to the Idol.
 _Dev Note: Idolatry is aimed at a Carapace replacement.
Carapace, although intent on “making mobs slightly tougher”,
ended up doing it in a way that was disproportionately harsh on
slow weapons and easy to counter on fast weapons. Idolatry is
supposed to support “mobs being slightly tougher” with an Idol
which can be taken down both by heavy single-target and AoE._
&bBloodlust • Level 4 Experimental, 1pt/level&r
• When a regular mob is killed, 1 mob that's at least 5 blocks
away has a level &o 10% chance to leap to the player. When an
elite is killed, 3 mobs have a level &r 20% chance to leap.
&bCloaked • Level 3 Experimental, 3pts/level&r
• Mobs have a 70% chance to become cloaked on spawn. Cloaked
mobs are invisible and do not render armour.
• Mobs become uncloaked while within 8 • 2 &o level blocks of
any player.
&rDev Note: Cloaked 3 is a hilarious experience, but can be
quite unbalanced. If you are looking to experience the delve mod
for the first time, Cloaked 1 or 2 is recommended.&o
&bRegenerating • Level 3 Experimental, 1pt/level&r
• All mobs passively heal at a rate of ([6 &r level] + 6)% HP
per second.
• Dealing direct damage with a spell or weapon to a mob
interrupts the healing for 2 seconds.
• Damage over time effects do not cancel the healing.
&bBountiful • Level 1 Experimental, 5pt/level&r
• Most spawner ranges are doubled.### Delve Modifier Changes:
