&b(11.10.0)&r
For the update on April 2, 2025
### Guild Plots
&bIt's moving day!&r
Guild plots and islands are now moving from the `plots` shard to
the `guildplots` shard! We're also removing the rent to visit
your guild island, and offering a refund on any upkeep you've
paid in advance. Note that it'll take us about two hours after
weekly update to move all of the existing guild plots, so you
don't have to.
• Orin lets you travel between the guild plots you have access
to from any shard, and remembers which one you last visited.
• Guild plots are now 451x508x451 block worlds, much like a
larger version of playerplots; between their location and use of
barrier blocks instead of bedrock, these are ideal for map art.
• To help navigate this space, Travel Anchors have been added;
purchasable shulker NPCs you can dye different colors, rename,
and teleport between.
• Guilds can now control which players can access inventories,
use survival mode, use egginators, edit and/or use travel
anchors on their plot, move the spawn point, and change the time
of day.
• Guilds can now purchase a guild plot without moderator
intervention.
• The cost of a guild plot has gone up to 12 hyper and 6 daily
currency, which can be paid in any region's currency.
• The guildplots shard also has a guild hub anyone can access,
providing a calm place to chill. If the guild you're visiting
goes on lockdown or removes you from the guild, you will find
yourself here.
• If you find yourself trapped, `/stuck` will take you to the
guild hub.### Latepril Fools: Amplified Coven Fortress:
For the next two weeks, you can speak with Ageratina, the Blue
epic trader, to open an instance of Amplified Coven Fortress. Do
not expect a balanced experience; this has been made for fun,
and it is recommended to have a party of 3+ endgame players to
clear. If you manage to break 750 spawners and conquer the POI,
you'll be rewarded with a seasonal advancement!
### Depths & Zenith Changes:
Players will be blocked from spawning new rooms if a Twisted
miniboss currently exists in the world.

### Minor New Features:
• Added Shared Vaults. These are like the Bag of Hoarding in
that they can hold every currency, but in block form, and with
their inventory tied to the block instead of accessible from
anywhere. They can be used to share loot between members of a
guild, just yourself, or made available to anyone who can reach
them for dungeons.
