&bMinor New Features:&r
• There's a new simplified tab list offered through the PEB's
technical options! If you have an up to date Unofficial
Monumenta Mod (1.9.8 Beta +) this is recommended, as you can get
your effects overlay from the client mod and the tab list will
no longer show the custom effects and will limit the patron
shrine listings to active ones, increasing space for players on
the tab list.

require holding a projectile weapon

bug.Said major bug has now been hotfixed, and the minigame is
