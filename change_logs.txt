&b(10.30.0)&r
For the update on April 4, 2024
&bMinor New Features:&r
• Ability Hotbars (Experimental)
  • New PEB functionality to toggle on / off an Ability HUD (PEB
-> Gameplay Options -> Ability Hotbars), displaying information
of cooldowns, stacks and modes from various class abilities and
depths / zenith active abilities as a boss bar (similar to a
certain Njol's mod used by many)!
  • Future Work: Customizability of HUD (renaming skills,
reordering, recoloring), changing placement of hotbars to
actionbar or scoreboards, and RP integration some day.• The
Embers have been added to the delve section of the Bestiary
• Various Delve mobs in the Bestiary have received lore blurbs!
Thanks @ellie._ for their contributions writing these blurbs
&bRegarding the Future of the Seasonal Pass:&r
• The Seasonal Pass will once again be on break this week due to
several circumstances. What was envisioned as a low effort way
to give players fun challenges to complete each week has
unfortunately become a drain on developer resources that make it
difficult to create new and exciting pass content/rewards such
as Elite finishers, Seasonal Pass Hub changes, and unique,
exciting pass missions. The development team is reevaluating how
we wish to run Seasonal Passes, but you can expect rewards and
the pass mission structure to be similar when it returns.
&bMarket:&r
• Yet another attempt at fixing the ownership loss. No new
features will be added to the market until this is fixed.
• In case the fix doesn’t work, a better tool is available for
moderators. No need to know your listing IDs anymore.
• With the balance changes this week, this will be the first
time item replacements are run on the market data. Keep an eye
out for issues related to item changes.
&bWarlock Revamp:&r
Warlock is receiving some ability revamps this update! This
mainly aims to increase its build diversity by strengthening
level 2 choices and lowering the necessity to take 1 point in
every skill. Its healing is also being looked at, particularly
the strength of Soul Rend.• Choleric Flames L2: The damage is
increased to 5, and
&balso afflict mobs with -100% Healing for 7s. (Counts as a
level 1 debuff.)&r
• Grasping Claws L2: Increase the Slowness to 30%.
&bAfter the projectile lands, your next melee scythe attack
within the next 4 seconds will deal 4 + 10% of the attack's
damage as magic damage in a 3 block radius.&r
• Melancholic Lament L2: Increase the Weaken to 30% and casting
this ability decreases the duration of all negative potion
effects on players in the radius by 10s.
&bYour next melee scythe attack within the next 4 seconds will
silence all mobs in a 3 block radius for 3s.&r
• Sanguine Harvest: Now applies Bleed 2 and has a 4-block radius
at both levels. Now explodes at max range instead of requiring
mob/block collision. New L2:
&bIncrease the mark's healing to 10% of max health. Melee
attacks against marked mobs heal the player for 10% of their max
health, deal 10% more damage, and consume the mark.&r
• Phlegmatic Resolve:
&bNow capped at 3 abilities on cooldown.&r Resistance buffed
from
&b+1.5%/+2.5% to +3%/+5% Resistance&r, and knockback resistance
buffed from
&b+0.5 to +1 KBR&r.
• Soul Rend: L1 now
&bheals 5 health&r. New L2:
&bThe attacked enemy is marked for 8s, allowing your next 2
critical scythe attacks against them to heal you for 10% of the
damage dealt, capped at 2.5 health per hit. Killing the enemy
heals you for 1.5 health for each remaining mark on the mob.&r
Healing from this ability now applies to all players within 7
blocks of you.
  • Dark Pact's L2 interaction remains unchanged, allowing Soul
Rend to heal 2/4 HP when triggered.

advised to complete the dungeon in a single sitting to avoid
instance corruption.
