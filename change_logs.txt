&b(10.58.0)&r
For the update on October 17, 2024
### Major New Features:
&bCreeperween 2024: Oh The Creepery!&r
Spooky season is here once again! Creeperween has returned to
Monumenta, re-introducing the same tricks and treats that were
present last year.
• Discover Creeper's Delights across the world and feed them as
a snack to Creepers for some rather... &oexplosive&r results. If
you manage to survive, make sure to take the Bags of Tricks that
they leave behind!
• Have a conversation with Creeper Fanatic Boris at the
Sierhaven Apartments to earn a seasonal advancement & trade for
event rewards using Bags of Tricks. He may also have an
additional task for you in the near future...
• Note that once the event ends, you will no longer be able to
feed Creeper's Delights to Creepers until next year. Although,
you will still be able to eat them... with significantly more
boring results!
&bDepths & Zenith Update&r
This update introduces celestial gifts, improves talisman
quality of life, and levels out balance outliers especially in
curses. Please enjoy and let us know what you think!
&bCelestial Gifts&r &o(Zenith Only)&r
A brand new system that serves to further make every run unique!
After defeating a boss, rather than earning a twisted ability,
that will be merely one option for players to upgrade their kit.
Players will now select between three celestial gifts, with one
possibility guaranteed to always be the twisted ability in the
case that the others don't work well for them. In total, there
are over twenty gifts to discover and explore!
&bTalisman Changes:&r
At the start of a run, you can now choose a secured tree for the
run out of 3 random options. If you have an active talisman,
your tree is guaranteed to be one of the three. One of the three
options gives you a 15% treasure score boost for the run, capped
at 10 treasure score. If you have an active talisman, it will
never be your tree that is boosted.
Rigged keys have been removed.
&bPrismatic Changes:&r &o(Zenith Only)&r
All damaging prismatics now scale slightly with each ascension
level. Some damage abilities have had their numbers slightly
tweaked to account for this.

Multiplicity: Cooldown reduction increased by 10% at all levels
Opportunity: Rerolls 1/2/3/4/5/7 -> 1/1/2/3/4/6

time is lost

&bYou've Got Mail!&r
• Players and guilds may now send and receive items through a
new `/mail` command, as well as through a new tab in the guild
GUI. You can access this from almost anywhere, and send almost
anything, including containers with other items, or player-
written books.• There are now guild permissions for managing
guild mail and guild shops, which are granted to guild managers
by default, and can be granted to guild members, but not guests
of the guild. Guild permissions may now be revoked for guild
members/managers if a guild deems it necessary.
• With these changes, we are one step closer to moving guild
plots and islands to separate worlds. This will allow an
unlimited number of guilds to own a plot and an island, and make
adding guild permissions for survival mode and accessing items
feasible.
### Minor New Features:
• Changed how particles are processed behind the scenes to
improve shard performance. This should allow for more granular
per-player particle settings in the future.
    • Note: Please report if there are any bugs with how
particles are displayed. Specify the ability/mob/cosmetic in the
bug report if applicable.
• Added 9 new Hexed skins for Epoch Hammer, Hungering Moonbeams,
Hyperion, Resonant Scythe, Forgeflame Liquor, Serebrian Godbrew,
Mountain's Dew, Dreadwood Log, and Prismatic Enigma
  • Note that these skins will be no different visually until
the next Resource Pack version, v5.3.0, releases on October
20th.
• Added locked trades for all Hexed skins to The Vedha as
previews of their Resource Pack textures
• The Patreon player head in Sierhaven now encourages Mac users
to pledge using their browsers rather than the Apple store app •
