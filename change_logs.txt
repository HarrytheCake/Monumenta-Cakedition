&bHotfix:&r Ring Around the Rose is no longer impossible to

For the update on November 2, 2023
&bMajor New Features:&r
&bShaman: Region 3 Class Enhancements and Charms:&r
In continuation with the shaman release plan, all enhancements
and charms have been added alongside a skill rework in place of
Adhesive Totem and some further balance tweaks!
&oDev note: Thank you to those who have helped internally with
testing and balancing, namely Chiinox for help balancing ahead
of r3 shaman and throughout the beta testing, and to the players
for providing feedback over the months, provided enhancement
ideas (some of which you will notice made it through), and
overall helping keep things going!&r
&nMajor changes to existing logic/skills:&r
• Projectile flight path has been adjusted to having a max
flight time and x/z distance from the player before dropping
straight down.
• Flame Totem damage adjust from 4/6 -> 4/5, radius adjusted
from 7 at both levels to 6/7
• Lightning Totem damage adjusted from 16/24 -> 14/21
• Adhesive Totems has been replaced by Crystalline Combos:
&nCrystalline Combos&r:
Level 1: Every kill not caused by this skill grants you 1 stack
of crystals and after 15 stacks the crystals lash out at any
mobs within 12 blocks of you at a rate of 1 shot per 0.6s,
dealing 7 damage to each for a total of 16 shots. Stacks decay
at a rate of 1 stack per 8s.
Level 2: Damage increased to 10, number of shots increased to
20, stack decay rate is reduced to 1 stack per 12s, and stack
threshold is reduce from 15 to 12.&bEnhancements:&r
&nCleansing Totem&r: Throwing the totem cleanses the shaman and
heals 20% max health instantly. Directly hitting another player
with the projectile applies the same effects on impact.
&nFlame Totem&r: The totem now throws explosive fireballs at a
target within range every second that deal 6 magic damage in a
2.5 block radius and set mobs on fire for 2 seconds instead of
the base skill's approach. Applies inferno at 50% efficiency.
&nLightning Totem&r: If the totem kills a mob, there is a 75%
chance of it spawning a lightning rod at the mob's location. The
lightning rod will deal 50% of the main magic damage to all mobs
within 2 blocks of the rod every 2 seconds.
&nEarthen Tremor&r: Tremor now sends out an additional 6
shockwaves from the edge of the radius outwards for an
additional 5 blocks with a radius of 3 blocks. Damage is
increased by 2.5.
&nTotemic Projection&r: For every totem affected by this
ability, the Shaman gets +10% Attack/Projectile damage for 6s.
&nInterconnected Havoc&r: Mobs are now knocked back from the
player when coming in contact with the line for the first time
and are stunned for 0.5s.
&nChain Lightning&r: Now causes each totem it bounces off of to
instantly pulse its effects at 60% efficiency for damaging
totems and 25% efficiency for the rest.
&nCrystalline Combos&r: Pressing swap while sneaking and holding
a projectile weapon will use all existing crystal stacks to
provide 2.5% speed per stack (max 90%) to the Shaman for 6s.
Decay rate reduced to 1 stack per 12s. Cooldown 4s.
&bCharms:&r
Charms have been added across the region's pois, dungeons,
strikes and more! As part of this, to allow for space, the
charms Cracked Pocketwatch, Ancient Shadowstone, Blade of the
Sealed, and Deepwrought Ruby have been relocated to the R3
Fishing rewards systems, and shaman charms have been put in
their place.&bMob Changes:&r
