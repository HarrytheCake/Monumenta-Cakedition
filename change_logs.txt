### Quest Compass Overhaul:
• The Quest Compass has been completely revamped! Right clicking
with a compass in hand will now open up a GUI with quests,
waypoints and deaths neatly sorted. Quest entries display their
name, messages, locations and distances thereto, as well as
signaling if an entry is on a different world. Additionally, the
rework comes equipped with a set of new QoL features:
  • Direct access to the already existing Quest Guides GUI at
the top
  • Shift-right clicking with the compass in hand will now cycle
through steps of the selected quest, instead of through all
quests
  • A button to stop tracking quests completely until one is
selected again
  • Information on using custom waypoints
• Bug fixes and miscellaneous:
  • Viewing respawn timers of nearby POIs has been changed from
shift-right click to shift-left click
  • Setting and deleting a custom waypoint will now update your
compass immediately
  • The Quest Compass item, Intro to Quest Compasses book and
compass dialogue by Nurse Deidre have been updated to reflect
the new functions
  • The /waypoint command now has an optional world name regex
field, mostly intended for dev-side usage. Defaults to your
current world when unset. The <coords> inline command uses the
world the sender was on at the time the message was sent.
• Specifying worlds in quests is a brand new feature, so please
create a bug report if you encounter a quest entry on a
different world that is not shown as being correct.
