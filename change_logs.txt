For the update on February 19, 2025
### Minor New Features:
• A Dummy to test damage related enchantments like Stamina and
Thorns has been added to the Markus in New Antium
• Abilities with modifiable triggers now have modifications
reflected in their description
  • Some possible modifications are not included as they would
make the descriptions potentially too long without being more
useful
  • Modifiable triggers are highlighted yellow
  • Swap and drop triggers are now listed as "Press [key]" where
[key] is the key you have bound to swap/drop (i.e. F and Q by
default). Right and left clicks are still listed as such because
Minecraft would call them "Right Button" and "Left Button" which
is worse.
• Abilities with charms now have (almost all) modified values
from charms reflected in their descriptions, similar to Zenith
abilities
• A few abilities which have different numbers in different
regions will now have those numbers dynamically update based on
which region the player is in while viewing the description
• Some ability descriptions have had minor changes to wording or
formatting for consistency, clarity, etc.
### Feedback Fixes:
• A Shaman's Lament now places colored concrete under the
potions
• Added an Assist Mode option to the Tower segment of An
Unexpected Lesson
• You can now quick-leave and quick-return to the Tower and boss
segments of An Unexpected Lesson, quick traveling between those
areas of the quest and the summit near Wispervale
• The colored concrete in the Mirrored Egos puzzle has been
replaced with colored glazed terracotta### Mob Changes:
• Crystal Behemoth :
  • 60 -> 50 Blast damage on Meteor Slam hit
  • 6 -> 4 block Meteor Slam damage radius
  • 90% -> 75% Slowness on Projectile spell hit
  • The spell cast order, spell cooldowns, and Meteor Slam's
velocity have been modified to make the boss less likely to jump
off its arena and prevent the projectile spell from being an
unavoidable hit in certain situations
• Coven Overseer now requires line of sight to summon spiders &
slimes

• By My Blade's Haste duration is now affected by the By My
Blade Attack Speed Duration charm effect
• Fixed Emerald Ascension being non-functional

effect not being shown in red

Meteor Slam attack would continue to place blocks

spell hit
