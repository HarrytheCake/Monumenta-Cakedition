### Seasonal Pass
• We hoped you enjoyed the mechanical theme featured in the
previous Seasonal Pass! We're sure all of the sounds of
mechanical whirring and gears turning started to get old after a
while. Now, we have a brand new Seasonal Pass, corresponding
with the brand-new Rush of Dissonance rework: The
&bPass of Dissonance&r, featuring cosmetics and builds related
to Harmony and Dissonance!
• Unlock brand new Titles, Mob Dummies, Elite Finishers, and
other rewards as you progress through the usual 13 weeks of pass
missions. Additionally, we have introduced five brand-new extra
tiers to the rewards track, containing extra tokens as a reward
for those who continue completing missions!
• One new Seasonal Pass Artifact has been added to the Relic
Wheel pool! A second one may be coming within the next few
weeks.
• The Seasonal Pass GUI has been slightly reworked, specifically
under the Rewards tab, to improve organization and allow support
for the new tier count in this Seasonal Pass.
• Due to a mistake when setting up the Marsh Madness Pass, every
monthly mission since then has been considered a "Bonus"
mission, making it easier to get the Tryhard title.
Unfortunately, this change was unintentional. To fix this
problem without being too punishing, we have decided to meet in
the middle • the third monthly mission, on Weeks 9 to 12, will
remain as a Bonus mission, while the other two will not.
• Head to the Seasonal Pass Lobby to start your new adventure,
in celebration of the new Rush of Dissonance!
&bHotfix 11.39.1 (for daily restart):&r
• Fixed rush memory leak
&bHotfix:&r
• Replaced the duplicate Sunblessed title reward in the season
pass
&bHotfix:&r
• Teal should now properly count as a Wool Dungeon for the
current Seasonal Pass multiweek mission
&b(11.40.0)&r
For the update on October 29, 2025
### Minor New Features:
• Following the 5.9.0 resource pack update, 10 new hope skins
have been added to Mastersmith Antonio's store! Thank you very
much to our patrons for your continued support!
• Potion Barrels now show a copy of the potion that's inside,
removing the need for signs or item frames to keep track of
which potion is where
• Due to issues with ViaVersion, it is advised to play on only
Minecraft 1.20.4, not 1.20.5 or higher. You are still able to
connect with up to 1.21.4 for the moment, but this will no
longer be mentioned in the server list's message. Once we've
updated past 1.20.4, connecting with later versions will likely
be stable again.
