&bHotfix:&r When beginning Voyage of Discovery, Captain Argoun
will no longer say you need to complete Crew to Remember when
you have already done so
&b(10.21.0)&r
For the update on February 1, 2024
&bMajor New Features:&r
&bAssisted Dreaming:&r
A new quest, Assisted Dreaming, has made its way to New Antium.
Having recently arrived in the Architect's Ring, your old friend
Reynart requires some assistance in order to hunt down the
source of the nightmares that plague the region. A new chapter
in the Architect's Ring story awaits!
This quest acts as the introduction to Exalted dungeons, and can
be started by speaking to Reynart near New Antium after having
completed Cure for Insomnia and the King's Valley Monument.
It should be noted that you may still access the Exalted hub
regardless of quest status, Reynart and crew will simply no
longer be present until completion. Likewise, External
Corruption has had its starting requirement switched to
completion of Assisted Dreaming.

of Winter!
