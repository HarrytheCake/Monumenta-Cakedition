&bHotfix&r for daily restart:
• Whisper channels load again
&b(11.51.0)&r
For the update on January 21, 2025
• The Pass of Dissonance has been extended by a week to make up
for the missing time due to the day-long server outage that
happened this week. These "Week 14" missions will be of similar
difficulty as Week 13's missions, and will also provide the same
point values (100/200/300 MP).
### Minor New Features:
• With this weekly update, most race leaderboards have been soft
reset, something that has been a long time coming at this point.
This was done due to many factors • primarily because of the
power of Dark Thunder, as well as player desire from a poll back
in 2024 (see https://discord.com/channels/313066655494438922/337
804190648893441/1260453584710008905).
  • Most race leaderboards have been given a "reasonable
completion time" that was better than Master time; every player
who was faster than this time has been moved to it.
  • With this soft reset, Dark Thunder has been legacied.
• Added `/mail speeddial`, which keeps the recipients of your
choice at the top of `/mail`, even when you haven't sent
anything lately; this also moves mail from those recipients to
the top of your mail GUI, if there is any
• World bosses and strikes no longer accept keys if it is too
close to a scheduled server stop
• When in a Silver Knight Remnant, left-clicking your compass
will display the room name and author(s)
• Updated the book of SKR room credits near the Record-Keeper###
