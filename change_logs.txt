For the update on December 17, 2025
### &nA Union Cross:&r
A new quest, and the next installment in Region 3's Chapter J,
has arrived • A Union Cross!
A powerful nightmare has appeared within the dreamscape, one
that threatens to draw the attention of Samara's demon and see
it gain an indomitable boon. She requests your aid in dispelling
it, but secrets lie dormant within the dream, and you'll be
forced to make a decision that will set the course for the
future of the entire Architect's Ring...
A Union Cross is one of the largest and most ambitious quests
we've ever attempted to make, and features a unique "open zone"
style unseen in Monumenta quests prior, focusing heavily on
exploration and utilizing the scenarios around you to progress.
To begin the quest, you may speak to Reynart in the Exalted
lobby after completion of External Corruption and Unconventional
Methods!
&o&nDev Commentary:&r It's hard to believe I'm actually able to
finally write this changelog post. I've been planning, writing
for, and developing this quest for over two years (first draft
was in November 2023!!), and this release is the culmination of
all that work. To quote Fang, "This is his Study in Crimson",
and I certainly hope it lives up to that level of excitement.
Thank you all in advance for playing and experiencing this story
that I have poured so much of my time and energy into, and I
hope you all enjoy. —Crondis&r### Class Abilities:
• All class abilities have received an updated set of
descriptions, in a completely new, fresh and unique style!
  • These new descriptions aim to turn what was once one long
block of unformatted text into organized, styled paragraphs and
stats. With colors!
  • Simple descriptions have been removed, and you will see more
detailed information about the ability in that location instead,
including a display for what charm effects you have for that
ability.
  • In addition to abilities, all classes and specializations
have also received new descriptions, as well as all other items
in the GUI! I suggest you hover over everything to check it all
out.
  • Some descriptions will dynamically update based on certain
criteria, such as:
    • Your current point assignment, or remaining points
    • What region you're in
    • What charms you have equipped
  • Added a display and sound for attempting "blocked" actions
like selecting skills without enough points, or selecting an
enhancement without the ability first
  • Depending on feedback, you may see other GUIs adopt this
visual style in the future as well.
  • More features are also planned to be added to this system in
the future!
