&bHotfix&r: Arclight and Royal Blue can now be started; the

not have access to the quest yet when you actually can. They
will be fixed tomorrow when we've had a chance to sort them out.

For the update on June 25, 2025
### Minor New Features:
• A brand new quest, celebrating Pride Month, has been added •
&bArclight and Royal Blue&r! It can be started at Cinevra in
Sierhaven, requiring The Crystal Connection (+A Little Spark)
and A Crown of Madness to play. Completing this quest rewards
some absolutely fabulous pride-themed skill cosmetics. Happy
pride! 🏳️‍🌈
• Heavily optimized the social system to improve server
performance
• Added a new PEB toggle under Technical Options to swap the
positions of the Friends and Guild sections in the tab list
• Fixed an issue where the Friends and Guild sections in the tab
list would be missing a separator if there were no moderators
online
• Guilds purchasing new plots now have new options to choose
from:
  • Lake Island is the existing plot type, which was made so
that guilds that purchased guild islands back when those were a
thing kept all their stuff without needing to rebuild everything
from scratch
  • Grassy Flatland is one layer of grass at y=56, and
everything under that is sand for easy clearing
  • Void is just empty with the usual barrier blocks; a
completely blank slate
  • The mod team has also volunteered to replace guild plots
with one of these templates if requested, though keep in mind
the contents of your plot will be lost, and you will not receive
the item equivalent of any of the blocks that are removed.

players present when it starts, where each player adds 30

match when it isn't allowed
• Fixed an armor stand being destructable in Old Antium.
• Fixed the TNT in the tutorial exploding instantly during its
