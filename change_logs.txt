&bHotfix:&r Kaul's arena now resets properly after a fight
concludes
&bHotfix:&r Leaving guilds now works, and the messages now

&b(10.25.0)&r
For the update on February 29, 2024
&bMajor New Features:&r
&bGuild Changes:&r
On <t:1709398800:F>, we will be taking the server network down
to update our guild infrastructure. Here's what we're adding:
• Founders can now invite players to your guild, whether online
or offline, as a full member or as a guest, with the use of
`/guild invite`
• Founders can now demote or kick non-founder guild members
without moderator intervention, as well as promote guild members
up to Founder with the use of `/guild access`
• Added a new Manager role within each guild that also allows
you to invite players to the guild, and entrusts you with the
ability to promote other guild members to manager, and kick
players with less access from the guild
• Added a new guest role to each guild, which allows you to
visit those guilds through a new right click action for Orin's
teleport GUI on plots
• Added a new `/guild gui` for all sorts of things (also
available in the Knick Knack Sack):
  • An emergency lockdown feature with a confirmation page.
Founders and managers can activate this in the event of trouble
within their guild, preventing changes to guild membership,
invites, and preventing access to the guild plot and island, all
while alerting the moderator team. Be warned that only a
moderator can lift a lockdown, and abusing this system may
result in moderators denying you access to this tool.
  • A list of who has access to your guild
  • A list of the guilds you have access to, including accepting
and rejecting invites
  • A complete list of every guild on Monumenta, include their
name, tag, and guild banner
• The ability to get your guild's banner with `/guild getbanner`
These changes give us more tools to interact with guilds in the
future • whether it be as exciting as moving guild plots and
guild islands to their own worlds, or as mundane as updating the
guild hall at Castle Narsen without needing to copy banners to
the build server.
