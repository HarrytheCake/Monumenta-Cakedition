&b(10.44.0)&r
For the update on July 11, 2024
&bMinor New Features:&r
• Added `/plot region`, which can be used to set your own region
while on plots/playerplots shards (for abilities, region
scaling, etc.). If the command has never been used, the plot
region will default to the latest region unlocked by the player
(and will update if new regions are unlocked). Celsian Isles
items continue to not be debuffed in plots even when the plot
region is 3. Note that the region is per player, so multiple
players on the same plot can have different personal regions.
• Shift left clicking the class summary item in a Mechanical
Armory loadout will now use the class icon as the loadout's
display item
• Added hotbar support to the Mechanical Armory for nine more
quick swap slots
• Added a new chat inline command, <equipment>, which lists all
worn equipment and mainhand when hovering over it. This aims to
make sharing builds easy and compact, removing the need to type
out long messages or fetch links from online sites.
• Cleric Cosmetic Set changes:
 • Fixed Awakening (Celestial Blessing) playing its effect once
for every player in range, rather than only once
 • Fixed Telekinesis' (Enchanted Prayer) tuff block item display
disappearing if anyone triggered the on-hit effect, rather than
only the caster
 • Tweaked sounds and/or particles for Awakening, Bloodbath,
Contorting Bolt, Animating Aura, Hypnotic Chant, Impaling
Distortion, Rippling Beam, Purging Pyre, Soul Strain and
Vitality Extraction
&bItem Changes:&r
• Frost Giant's Crescent : 0.7 -> 0.8 Attack Speed, 21 -> 20
Attack Damage
• Hrimnir's Incisor : 20 -> 22 Attack Damage
• Marauder's Haze : 9 -> 11.5 Attack Damage, 2 -> 1.6 Attack
Speed

• Gambler's Cane : 4 -> 6 Chaotic, 15.5 -> 16.5 Attack Damage
• Demon's Scar : 9 -> 10 Attack Damage, 2 -> 1.7 Attack Speed
  • &oDeveloper Note: These scythe changes were meant to launch
last week but were missed during item updates. Previously,
scythe choices in Region 2 were limited to fast attack speed or
slow-swinging scythes with few viable options in the middle. A
few slow-swinging scythes were given a small buff to improve
their viability and two underperforming scythes were reworked to
middle-ground attack speed.&r
