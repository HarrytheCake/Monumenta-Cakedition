### Mini-Balance Update #1:
&oWe're doing some early balance and QoL changes to Seraph and a
new item added last week to address feedback and oversights in a
timely manner. There will be more changes next week and we may
continue doing more until things have stabilized and Seraph is
more finely tuned. For clarification, there will not be changes
to items or classes that weren't affected by (or relevant to
changes from) last week.&r

between exactly 3 and ~3.8 blocks off the ground. Levitation

Mob Changes:
• Hycenea: 210k -> 250k health
• Ru'Ten: 60k -> 75k health

revert Ru'Ten's health and settled for a ~10% nerf to Hycenea
(from 275k before last week).&r
