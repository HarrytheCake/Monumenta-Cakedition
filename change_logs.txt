Remains, has arrived! Venture back to the Valley, and delve into

### Monumenta Music Pack Version 4.1.25
• A new song has been added to the official Music pack: Wake Me
Up Before You Indi-go-go • thank you @Wham! for your
contribution! <https://youtu.be/pIgZ7gMze7A?si=2zNi43fM1fzpLh4K>
### Monumenta: Runestones:
We're delighted to announce that we are nearing the finalization
of a deal to distribute &nour upcoming TCG&r •
&bMonumenta: Runestones&r.
As such, we're looking to move out of Alpha Testing and open up
Beta Testing for our amazing Discord members. While art and
balance are
&bnot&r finalized, the game is very playable in its current form
and we're looking for feedback to see what kind of decks the
community can create and balance issues we may not have noticed.

[The card images can be found here, for downloading or to port

/folders/1U_Qwggg3mqc3hQU0T1tVGJbZiuzJiY-3)
We've used Cockatrice and Roll20 to facilitate testing in the
past, and would recommend those tools to try things out. Thank
you!
&oFor those who served as Alpha testers, please remember that
you are under an NDA and may not discuss your experiences with
the Alpha.&r### Violet Wool:
We are excited to release the new dungeon that has been in
development for a very long time •
&bThe Violet Wool Dungeon&r!
Assembled from all previous dungeons, this dungeon offers a
unique mechanic •
&binverted controls&r, thanks to the power of
&bViolet Wool&r!
Since our players &ojust love&r chaotic and unexpected
encounters, the controls are inverted at random times during the
dungeon playthrough! We are absolutely certain that you will
love this new thrilling experience!
Moreover, being the wool of inversion, every death in a dungeon
takes away one level from the player, so preparation is
essential. Good luck!

that will work similar to playerplots. If you need anything from
your guild plot between <t:1743634800:F> and <t:1743647400:t>,
please plan accordingly. You will then have access to a survival
world 451x508x451 in size, with your existing guild plot and
island automatically transferred over.### Mob Changes:
