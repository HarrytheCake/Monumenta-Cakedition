&bMajor Bug Fixes:&r
• All shops that are overdue on upkeep will now be locked during
weekly updates, regardless of whether you disabled locking them
or not. This should help make it more obvious when your shop is
about to expire. Note that shops still only lock automatically
during weekly update; since shops expire after 14 days overdue
on upkeep, this means potentially you will have 7-14 days of
your shop being locked to notice and pay the upkeep before it
expires, depending on when update happens. Keep your shop paid
up to avoid losing it or having it locked.
