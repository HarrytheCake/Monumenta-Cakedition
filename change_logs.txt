For the update on February 15, 2024

place on individual shards, and have been converted over to our
world instancing system out of the Ring shards

for the contribution
• The weighting of normal rooms in the Shifting City has been
rebalanced

long time. This will reduce shield break times in R2 and R3 by
~30% to ~40%.
