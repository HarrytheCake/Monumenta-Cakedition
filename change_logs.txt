&bExalted Malevolent Reverie&r
• Exalted Malevolent Reverie has been added to the Exalted Hall.
Take on brand new challenges in the reprised version of Region
1’s capstone dungeon, and purchase remastered versions of iconic
items from them!
• Exalted Reverie will be made available this weekend, opening
up at our usual launch window at <t:1699722000:F>.
• As a reminder, Exalted Dungeons count as your instance of that
dungeon for the week, so you cannot run a non-Exalted and an
Exalted version of the same dungeon in one week. Additionally,
Exalted Dungeons can be done to complete Season Pass objectives
and Delve Bounties, and the leaderboard for completions is
shared between Exalted and basic versions.
&bMinor Changes:&r
• The monuments now stay completed for anyone who has completed
the monument. The wools will disappear if someone nearby has not
completed the monument, or if a moderator is in creative mode in
the area.
• Cut particle count of Galactic Rain (Coup de Grace cosmetic)
to reduce lag, no noticeable visual change
• Updated the legacy Omnilockbox trade to display refunded
materials
• Creeperween 2023 has ended, and as such Creeper Fanatic Boris
has ceased spreading his Bag o' Treats across Monumenta. If you
have any remaining Creeper Delights from the event that you
would like to use, they may be used on creepers for one more
week before being disabled until next year's event.

with music for the Alchemy Labs dungeon. Download it here –
