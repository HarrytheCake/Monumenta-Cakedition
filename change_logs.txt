&bShow your moves in MONUMENTA FESTIVAL!&r
‚Ä¢ This update, we're releasing the first of many new gamemodes
in the Monumenta Universe ‚Ä¢ Monumenta Festival! In &oMonumenta
Festival&r, give those mobs a break from hits and mix hit music
instead! Clucking and goat horns both showed us how much
Monumenta players enjoy making noise in Minecraft. We thought
this would be a more productive route for being loud and
actually put you on center stage. To start we've got 8 familiar
songs you know and love!
‚Ä¢ This gamemode is a rhythm game with the spirit of &oGuitar
Hero&r, where you play along with a track. In our Minecraft
implementation, you hit coloured wooden buttons to the beat.
Choose songs for your setlist, then compete with your friends to
get the highest score. This event will take place inside New
Antium, so help your newer player friends fast track to get
there ASAP!
&bMinor New Features:&r
‚Ä¢ Clicking on the recipe book in the inventory now opens the
Player Details GUI instead of the Player Stats GUI (The Player

recipes page when clicking on the recipe book

page

challenge trophy in your inventory
