### Region Three Epic Costs:
R3 has developed to the point we can comfortably swap in Mythic
Shards in place of Har in Epic trades, as is standard in R1 &
R2. Fecund Berry Basket, Nihilo Core, Iridium Injector, Bag of
Hoarding, and armory remain as Har for accessible progression.
• The Fatekeeper now sells &nMythic Shards&r for 1 Har + 4
Pulsating Shards
• Standardized&n Epic Charms&r to 16 Mythic Shards + 48 Epic
Materials: Silver Strings, Unstable Reactor, Cry Havoc, Coven
Vial, Hexcrafted Siphon, Final Herald's Lifeblood, Lunacrestum
Pulsar, Bottled Font of Tuulen, Harrakfar's Roar, Malignant
Neuron, Parasomnic Remnant, Lacryphagy, Aether Turbine, Rocket
Boots, Gears of the King, Malhuer Reach, Toxic Steroid,
Quickening Mycosis, Bewitching Lantern, Lifewood Dew, Ironwood
Vambrace, Briar of Binding, Serebrian Lineage, Origin of Void,
Null Agglomerate.
• Standardized &nEpic Items&r to 24 Mythic Shards + 64 Epic
Materials: Chimera's Grace, Veilripper, Worldshaper's Loom,
Alcyoneus, Covenmourn Rend.&nAdditional Item Changes:&r
• Ruby's Rose : 0 -> 2 Sweeping Edge, 1 -> 2 Fire Aspect
• Witchbane Revolver (M4) (Rework) : Multi-Load 5, Reflexes 1,
Retrieval 3, Unbreaking 5, 17.5 Projectile Damage, 1.2
Projectile Speed, +10% Speed
### Additional Balance Changes:
• Lesser Remedy Charm: -7.5% -> -10% Warding Remedy Pulse Delay
• Greater Remedy Charm: -15% -> -20% Warding Remedy Pulse Delay
&oDeveloper note: This does not actually change the effect of
either charm. We've fixed a rounding error with charms that
modify durations, and as such these charms are being updated to
act the same as before.&r
• Rampage now has a 6s cooldown after its duration expires
• Rampage's base duration is increased to 5s (from 3s)
&oDeveloper Note: This change aims to reduce the number of times
rampage needs to be activated in combat, and promote the use of
Berserker's other abilities.&r
• Glorious Battle now scales off of critical hit instead of base
damage.
  • AoE damage: 50% / 60% -> 30% / 40%
  • Critical damage: 75% / 90% -> 50% / 60%
-# This does not influence the strength of Glorious Battle.
