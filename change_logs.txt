Shifting has been reopened as a result of this fix.
&b(10.34.0)&r
For the update on May 2, 2024
&bMajor New Features:&r
&bHope Skin Obtainment Rework:&r
This week sees a total overhaul to the process by which you can
obtain Hope skins on an item! Gone are the days of tirelessly
pinging an older player in a desperate effort to get their skin
on an obscure item • as all Hope skins are now publicly
available at a whim!
• Upon speaking to Mastersmith Antonio in Highwatch, you will be
presented with a new GUI, which allows you to choose between
applying normal Hope (cost 9 SotM / 3 HXP) or applying skinned
Hope (cost 12 SotM / 4 HXP)
• By choosing to Hope Skin an item, you will enter the Hope Skin
GUI, where you can choose from all currently available Hope
skins for that item at your leisure
• You may now choose to re-apply Hope on an item that already
has the infusion, effectively swapping the "Hoped by" name on an
item and allowing you to place a skin on an item that was
already infused, for the difference of the two costs (3 SotM / 1
HXP)
• Antonio's dialogue has been significantly cleaned up, and the
process of un-Hoping an item has been shifted over to
Mastersmith Sofia. Note: Un-Hoping a skinned Hope item will only
return 9 SotM, not 12 • so make sure you absolutely wish to do
this before proceeding.
&nAs a note&r: In order to make the most of this new system and
experience as many of the skins as possible, we recommend using
the latest Unfoolsified 5.0.0 version of the resource pack.

displays the duration of silence effects if the player is
silenced
&bMarket Plugin • Filters Part 3/3: Anti-Prog-Skipping&r
• Coming this week, items that originate from content that you
have not unlocked will not show up in your market browser.
  For example:
 • You need to reach the Architect's Ring in order to see any
Architect's Ring item.
 • You need to finish 'Soul of the Forest' quest, or beat the
Yellow wool dungeon, to see any Vernal Nightmare items.
• Because you cannot buy something that you cannot see, this
acts as an anti-prog-skip mechanic, just inside of the market
plugin.
• If you somehow find one of the hidden items, and want to sell
it, you still can do so.
• A small part of the config for this is missing, and will be
added over time, but we might have missed some. If you see
something in the market that you think you should not have
access to -> bugreport
• Opposedly, if you do not see something, and you have beaten
the content it comes from, -> bugreport
• With this feature also comes a custom-ordering for the filter
editor • Component selection tab.
  It used to display possible values in the alphabetical order,
but now the order is more 'logical'
  (for example, for the Locations values, it goes R1 overworld
-> R1 dungeons -> R1 strikes -> R1 bosses -> R2 overworld... and
so on)
• Still in the filter editor • Component selection tab, some
values now have an 'icon' that represents the values themselves
  (regions have banners of their respective regions, wool
dungeons have a wool block corresponding to their color, and so
on)
  A LOT of those icons are missing, and will be added over time.
Consider this a proof of concept ;3
&bItem Changes:&r
• Myriad's Rapier : 11.5 -> 10.5 Attack Damage
&bVoodoo Bonds&r
• Voodoo Bonds has moved away from a passive and into an active,
making it so your AoE is more decisively used. It has received a
damage buff to compensate for this, and a level 2 that can
create chain reactions.
• L1: Left click while holding a projectile weapon to fire a pin
that instantly travels forward for 10 blocks and hits the first
3 mobs or players in its path. Mobs hit take 3 melee damage and
are cursed for 8s. When a cursed mob takes non-ailment damage
(except from this ability), all other mobs of the same type in a
3 block radius take 20% of the suffered damage. Players hit are
bonded to you instead; the next hit they take in the next 8s
will be redirected to you based on the percentage of health that
player would have lost, but cannot reduce your health below 1.
Charges: 2. Charge Cooldown: 10s.
• L2: Pins now pierce all mobs and players in their path instead
of stopping at 3. Mobs hit by Judgement Chain automatically have
a pin fired at them. When a cursed mob dies, 3 other cursed mobs
take 6 melee damage and have their curse extended by 3s.
&bReaper Charms&r
Charms for Judgement Chain and Voodoo Bonds have also been
reworked accordingly:
• Lesser Prosecutor's Charm: 1 Charm Power, +5% Judgement Chain
Weakness/Slowness Amplifier
• Greater Prosecutor's Charm: 2 Charm Power, +10% Judgement
Chain Weakness/Slowness Amplifier
• Distant Prosecutor's Charm: 2 Charm Power, +50% Judgement
Chain Range, +50% Judgement Chain Extra Targets Radius
• Swift Prosecutor's Charm: 3 Charm Power, -15% Judgement Chain
Cooldown, +0.5 Judgement Chain Debuff Duration
• Distant Linked Charm: 1 Charm Power, +50% Voodoo Bonds Pin
Range, +50% Voodoo Bonds Curse Radius
• Soul Synchronizer: 2 Charm Power, -30% Judgement Chain
Cooldown, -100% Judgement Chain Debuff Duration
&bClass Changes:&r
• Shield Wall: 4 -> 2.75 radius while moving. If stationary, the
radius is unchanged at 4 blocks. Reduced particles, and
particles now scale with radius
• Will of Ganzir: -45% -> -20% Radius (which cancels out with
the base radius change)
&bReaper Revamp&r
Reaper is receiving some changes this update! Judgement Chain
has sat in a very awkward spot for a long time, and Voodoo Bonds
provides too much value for little investment. These changes aim
to give Reaper some more exciting tools to supplement its
attacks with and significantly increase the diversity of spec
point layouts you can use with it.
&bJudgement Chain&r
• Judgement Chain now has the power to bring mobs into melee
range directly, while still being able to apply a very strong
debuff. You may think of this as a mobility tool, except the
mobs are the ones moving to you. Fans of Ragecraft 4 may like
this one...
• L1: Swap hands while looking at an unchained mob within 20
blocks to teleport them in front of you and chain them to you
for 10s, taunting them and afflicting them with 40% Slowness and
40% Weakness for 2s. Bosses and crowd control immune mobs cannot
be teleported, but will still be chained and debuffed. Cooldown:
15s.
• L2: Judgement Chain now additionally teleports and chains the
2 closest mobs within 3 blocks of the targeted mob. Passively
gain 3% Strength and 3% Resistance for each mob currently
chained to you, capped at 5 mobs. Killing a chained mob extends
your Dark Pact by an additional 1s if you have one currently
active.• Cracked Pocketwatch: 3 Charm Power, -50% Voodoo Bonds
Curse Duration, +50% Voodoo Bonds Curse Radius, +20% Voodoo
Bonds Curse Death Damage, -20% Voodoo Bonds Cooldown
• Chaos Codex: 4 Charm Power, -40% Voodoo Bonds Cooldown, -40%
Voodoo Bonds Received Damage, +50% Voodoo Bonds Protection
Duration, -100% Voodoo Bonds Curse Duration
