Some highlights:
### Base Class
• The passive now allows you to use a "level 0" Gruesome, just
like you've always had access to a "level 0" brutal!
• Empowering Odor has been removed, and your base potion
recharge time has been reduced to 1.5s.
• In place of Empowering Odor, a new skill has been added and is
ready to make things spicy • Volatile Reaction!
• Some low-pickrate enhancements have been reworked: Gruesome,
Alchemical Artillery, Bezoar, and Iron Tincture.
• A new stat for bags has been added: Potion Recharge Rate. Your
base potion recharge rate is now altered by your chosen bag's
Potion Recharge Rate attribute. Swapping to another bag sets
your potions to 0.
### Apothecary
• Transmutation Ring has been revamped. Panacea and Warding
Remedy have been tweaked.
### Harbinger
• Scorched Earth has been revamped. Minor AI improvements to
Esoteric Enhancements, plus changes to spawning. Taboo has been
reworked.

## Shaman Rework
The Shaman Rework is here, with changes to almost every skill in
Shaman's kit. The rework has been worked on on-and-off for a
long time, and aims to address many issues with Shaman's kit. We
had a number of design goals:
• To increase the interactivity of Shaman's gameplay while
maintaining the core gameplay mechanic of using totems as a
resource.
• Reduce the amount of "cheesy" options shaman's current kit
promotes.
• Review the balance of Shaman in all three regions.
• Create new charm stats to be tinkered with for Shaman.
Shaman will likely need more ability reworks and tweaks as time
goes on (on a smaller scale hopefully), but we are hoping that
these changes place Shaman into a more healthy position in the
long term. We hope the class provides some fun to those who dare
to brave its web of skill triggers (customization is
recommended).As a brief overview, we have:
• Reworked Flame and Lightning Totems for more interactive
gameplay.
• Moved Totemic Projection to become a passive for the class,
replacing the old one.
• Removed the Spec Passives that previously provided mostly
extra damage.
• Moved Crystalline Combos to become a Soothsayer ability as
"Spiritual Combos", replacing Sanctuary.
• Introduced two new abilities for the base class, "Ignition
Drive" and "Spiritualism".
• Redesigned the way Earthen Tremor deals damage, now
interacting with nearby totems and knocking mobs upwards.
• Replaced Chain Healing Wave and Desecrating Shot with two new
abilities, Totemic Consecration and Spiritcatcher Orbs
respectively.
• Overhauled almost every single Rare Shaman charm, or at least
tweaked in other cases.
• Reviewed the balance of the basic charms.
• New enhancements for some skills, and tweaked many of the old
class enhancements.
• Made many other small tweaks to the balancing of the skills.

## Berserker Rework
After a few delays, the Berserker rework is here! Initially,
Berserker was principally designed as a melee class. Over time
however, its skills have shifted away from traditional melee
gameplay towards a caster-like playstyle; a notable disconnect
from the class' original identity. This rework aims to preserve
and enhance the current movement-heavy gameplay of berserker,
and promote using basic melees as a core part of its gameplay
loop.
## Specialization Passive :
### Bloodlust (NEW)
• Gain Bloodlust upon dealing 70/120 melee damage, stacking up
to 10.
-# Rampage ability damage is excluded from counting towards
bloodlust.
-# Maximum bloodlust stacks per tick is 3.
-# 33% of melee damage from AoE contribute towards Bloodlust.###
Glorious Battle
• L1 : {Activation Trigger} lunges you forward at a velocity of
1.5, granting knockback immunity (vertical velocity is capped at
0.3). While airborne, colliding with nearby mobs deal 5 melee
damage. Critically attacking during Glorious Battle or 1.5s
after landing causes a large overhead swing, dealing 45% of your
weapon's damage to all mobs within 2.5 blocks of the target and
knocks them back. Critical strikes with Glorious Battle are
considered AoE. Cost: 2x Bloodlust Stack
• L2 : Glorious Battle now deals 8 melee damage on collision and
50% weapon damage on its overhead swing. Vertical Cap has been
removed. Additionally, the struck mob gains 2 stacks of
Bleeding.
### Meteor Slam
• L1 : Pressing {Activation Trigger} vaults you upward at a
velocity of 1.1 (reduced by 50% until landing), dealing 10 melee
damage within a 4 block cone and knocking mobs downwards.
Falling more than 3 blocks generates a slam where you land,
dealing 3 melee damage per block fallen, capping at 7 blocks.
Dealing any damage with Meteor Slam cancels all fall damage.
Cooldown: 5s. Cost: 1x Bloodlust Stack.
• L2 : Sneaking while midair (or using the custom trigger) now
performs a ground pound attack, lunging you downward at a
velocity of 2. Your next Meteor Slam is amplified:
  • +1.5 damage per block fallen.
  • +1.5 block radius.
  • 5s of fire.
  • 15% slowness for 2s.
  • Knocks back mobs.
Cost: 1x Bloodlust Stack.
### Rampage
• L1 : Press {Activation Trigger} to deal 6 melee damage and
knocking all enemies back within a 4 block radius. For the next
5s, you gain 20% more melee damage, and 5% max health regen per
second. Gaining a Bloodlust stack while this effect is active
extends its duration by 1s capping at 5 Bloodlust stacks. Cost:
4x Bloodlust Stack
• L2 : Rampage deals 10 damage. Grants 10% melee resistance, and
Bloodlust stacks now extend the effect's duration by 1.5s
each.## Berserker Charm Reworks :
### Epic/Rare Charms :
  • Bloodlust : 3 Charm Power, -15 Bloodlust Stack Threshold, +1
Meteor Slam Cost, +1 Rampage Cost
-# The aim here is to keep the design similar to its previous
iteration, giving more Glorious Battle activations overall.
  • Rocket Boots : 4 Charm Power, +2 Meteor Slam Ground Pound
Additional Damage, +2 Meteor Slam Max Height, +50% Meteor Slam
Ground Pound Additional Radius, +25% Meteor Slam Vault Velocity,
-70% Meteor Slam Damage
-# Rocket Boots prior to this rework was largely used in slam
builds to deal large radius AOE damage and to cover for the base
skill's poor base radius. The height and radius buffs will be
preserved here, and its damage will now be concentrated in the
Ground Pound portion of Meteor Slam.
  • Loci's Hunger : 3 Charm Power, +30% Ramage Damage, +30%
Rampage Radius, -1 Rampage Cost
-# Similar deal to Bloodlust, keeping it similar in niche as
before. More rampage activations, more damage output.
  • Silver Pauldron : 3 Charm Power, +25% Rampage Healing, +10%
Rampage Damage Buff, -30% Rampage Initial Duration, -30% Rampage
Duration Per Stack
-# The charm will keep its healing, but its ability damage will
be converted into a damage buff as an alternative option to
Loci's Hunger.
  • Hydraulic Chausses : 4 Charm Power, -2 Meteor Slam Fall
Requirement, -40% Meteor Slam Cooldown, +40% Meteor Slam Damage,
-20% Meteor Slam Vault Velocity, -2 Meteor Slam Max Height
-# Chausses' fall requirement is a staple stat of the charm,
carrying onto the new version. Alongside it, the charm will
decrease the required blocks to cap damage from 7 -> 5, while
decreasing the cooldown drastically.### Tiered Charms :
-# Many of the tiered Berserker charms are similar in function
or are the same as before, but a few have gotten stat changes or
reworks in accordance to the rework.
  • Focused Reckless Charm : +30% -> +20% Glorious Battle Damage
  • Greated Reckless Charm : +20% -> +10% Glorious Battle Damage
  • Lesser Reckless Charm  : +10% -> +5% Glorious Battle Damage

Slam Damage, +15% Meteor Slam Vault Velocity

Duration
  • Sustaining Rage Charm (Rework) : 2 Charm Power, +15% Rampage
Healing
&bScout Changes & Scout Charm Changes&r
• Quickdraw no longer inherits enchantments, aside from Recoil
and Aspects.
-# Quickdraw's ability to inherit certain enchants, most notably
Multishot, Piercing and Reverb, while ignoring other stats
caused a large disparity in the skill's strength between
weapons.• Quickdraw Volleys and Quickdraw Predator Strikes now
use the damage stat of Quickdraw rather than the held weapon.
-# This is technically a bug fix, but it has balance
implications that make it more fitting to include here. Due to
this bug and the above, certain weapons were used secondarily
for the purpose of amplifying Quickdraw's strength with Volley
and Predator Strike. For example, a high damage weapon could be
balanced by having a slow charge time, but Quickdraw would
simply bypass that downside and fire a full damage
Volley/Predator Strike instantly with the weapon's stats instead
of the Quickdraw's stats.
• Volley (u) has been nerfed : 5 times as many arrows in a 360
degree circle -> twice as many arrows in twice as wide an arc.
-# Volley (u) has for a long time been an absurdly strong
enhancement, so we're lowering its total area coverage
significantly and keeping just the forward facing area wide.
• Rending Razor : 6s / 4s -> 6s / 5s cooldown, 16+20 / 20+26 ->
14+20 / 16+24 damage
• Quickening Mycosis : -25% -> # -25% Rending Razor Embed
Damage, -25% -> # • 25% Rending Razor Rend Damage, -50% -> -45%
Rending Razor Cooldown
-# Charm stacking for Rending Razor has pushed the ability to
unhealthy extremes, so we've decided to lock Mycosis from most
upgradable charms to prevent stacking but let the charm still
remain powerful on its own.
• Loci Carving : -6 -> -5 Volley Arrows
• Fragmented Shaft : 1 -> 2 Charm Power
• Flesh Laurel (Rework) : 2 Charm Power, +50% Split Arrow Range,
-10% Split Arrow Damage
• Starseeker's Emblem : -50% -> #-50% Whirling Blade Damage
• Focused Lacerating Charm : 20% Embed / Rend Damage -> 15%
Embed / Rend Damage
• Lesser Rapacious Charm : +1 -> +0.5 Eagle Eye Refresh
• Greater Rapacious Charm : +2 -> +1 Eagle Eye Refresh

Range, 15% -> 10% Moonblade/Starfall Range/Radius
