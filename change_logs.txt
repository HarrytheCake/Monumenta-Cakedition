&bSierhaven Overhaul: Phase 5&r
After another hiatus, work has resumed on modernizing Sierhaven!
This phase, we specifically addressed the Eastern and Southern
sections of Sierhaven, including the Academy, but you'll notice
some other general changes as well! Please note there will be
some build inconsistencies in the meantime until the remainder
of Sierhaven is modernized.
• Revamped builds for the Academy and Eastern houses
• Revamped some of the bridges connecting to the swamp
• Added some new fortifications
• Added a new memorial in honor of the lost mages of Sierhaven
• Added two new parkours, replacing the Acrobat of the
Teleporters parkour
• Revamped Acrobat of the Tree parkour
• Revamped the kitchen area in Bane of the Bakers
• Relocated the Rare Framenting Station and Rare Trader to the
Forge
• Relocated multiple NPCs previously residing in Eastern
Sierhaven
&bMinor New Features:&r
• After dying, you will now view the location you died at for 3
seconds before being put in the normal death screen. Clicking
(after at least 0.5 seconds) will cancel this mode. This is
disabled in some locations, mostly in content such as strikes.
There is an option to toggle this feature in Gameplay Options in
the PEB.
&oNote: This feature has been tested for a number of weeks in
the play environment and multiple crucial bugs with it have been
fixed, but there are probably still some areas or situations
where it can cause issues. Please report any issues as soon as
you encounter them, and remember to do so using ModMail if there
is an abusable bug.&r• Punching a training dummy with an empty
hand while sneaking now toggles its mode to show the sum of
damage dealt over 10 seconds and total damage since toggling the
mode. This punch also resets the 'Max DPS' value to zero.
• Training dummies now immediately show the DPS of the last
second and last 10 seconds upon receiving damage instead of
being delayed by one and ten seconds respectively.

Southeastern Jungle

underground into the sewers, and no longer requires Magenta

immersion and give the player a taste of what awaits them
inside.

clicking them with other signs, and editing signs by right
clicking them with a book
