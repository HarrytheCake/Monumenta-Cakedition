• &rA large-scale Alchemist update is expected to release in
December, including several skill reworks and tweaks to address
various issues within the class in regards to ability mechanics,
skill point flexibility, bag design and more.&o
• &rWe've begun tackling Instant Health potions across the game
and moving to a healthier system, tentatively planned to release
in 2026. They've been a painpoint of gameplay for some years
now, with a notable discrepancy between playing with and without
PI/II.&o
• &rPlanning has started on a project to address overarching
issues in Region 3 that have come to light over the years since
its release, notably in terms of charms and enhancements, mobs
and delves, and the general damage-hungry nature of the region,
as classes and mobs have historically continued to one-up each
other in the region.&o
• &rDevelopment has picked up again on the Berserker and Shaman
reworks, and we hope to release both in the winter.&o
• &rA major Warlock rework is in the early conceptualizing
phase. Updates on progress and potential release dates will be
included in future balance roadmaps, for now it's too early to
estimate.&o
