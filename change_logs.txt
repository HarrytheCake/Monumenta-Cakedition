&bLoot Table Improvements:&r
• Many loot tables in the King's Valley have received major
backend changes to improve organization and eliminate technical
debt. Chances for items should remain unchanged but you are
encouraged to bug report items that do not drop at all or drop
more frequently than usual. The list of loot tables affected
includes:
  • All tier 3 through 5 items, which have been separated and
moved. This completes the separation of all R1 tiered items into
their own tables.
  • Many uncommon items, which have been separated and moved
  • Numerous miscellaneous items such as filler items, mob
drops, boss/dungeon keys, consumables, and some dungeon loot
chests
  • Rock's Little Casino's slot machines, where the chances for
items should not be changed (except for a fix to base potions
being slightly rarer than intended) but they are calculated
slightly differently • for example, the King's Warden has a
1/800 drop chance instead of a (1/80)&o(1/10) chance.

&bAn Unexpected Lesson&r
Another Region 2 storyline sees some love this week as a new
quest hits the Celsian Isles, An Unexpected Lesson!
Duchess Emmeline calls upon you for a mission once again,
following your "party" in Mistport. Something is different this
time though, as her right hand man, Salieri, seems to be keeping
something from her. Dive into the mysterious swordsage's past,
prove your skills in the combat art, and uncover an unnerving
secret that hides behind his servitude to Emmeline.
An Unexpected Lesson can be started by speaking to Tiffy in
Mistport, following the completion of The Olive Branch and
Unyielding Potential!
&bMinor New Features:&r
• In order to better communicate the numerous amount of
significant quests in Region 1 to players, the Valley's Mainline
GUI (and more broadly, what is considered mainline for the
region) has been drastically overhauled. Much like the chapter
system found in later regions, the King's Valley story has now
been reclassified into 4 individual "Tales" quest lines that
make up the full mainline
• Mage's Legacy, Tlaxan Troubles, Lost in My Mind, and Starry
Night now all have title pop ups that occur at quest start,
signifying the beginning of each mainline Tale series. Likewise
Unveiled, Shurima's Big Day Off, A Study in Crimson P2, and All
That Remains now have title pop ups signaling the end of a Tale
series• Fixed Angler's Rod never dropping when a chest rolls for
King's Valley tier 3 items
• Added Calamitous Rider, Boltshooter of Terror, Lancer of
Terror, Archer of Terror, and Colossal Creeper to the Bestiary
• Fixed an issue where Colossus of Chaos was not present in the
Bestiary because of the creeper of the same name

Expertise and Support Expertise

player died from a projectile
