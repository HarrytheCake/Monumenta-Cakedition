### Item Changes
&bArchitect's Ring Weapons&r
â€¢ Reaper's Harvest (M4) (Rework) : Decay 3, Quake 3, Smite 2,
Curse of Anemia 2, 24 Attack Damage, 0.7 Attack Speed, 4
Knockback Resistance
â€¢ Crescent of Dominion (M4) (Rework) : Ethereal 1, Duelist 2,
Thunder Aspect 2, First Strike 2, 16.5 Attack Damage, 1.1 Attack
Speed, 6 Thorns Damage
â€¢ Threadreaper (M4) (Rework) : Cumbersome, Ice Aspect 1,
Regicide 1, Slayer 3, 22 Attack Damage, 1.3 Attack Speed, +15%
Speed
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : These three scythes all suffered from
leaning too much into the specialist niche, and as such we're
reworking them to have more general use while still keeping some
specialist flavor. Reaperâ€™s Harvest is turning into a slow melee
weapon with capability to deal both large AOE and single target
damage, without needing to reach critspam speed to perform.
Crescent of Dominion is turning into a generalist defensive
scythe that has value on tankier builds with its innate First
Strike. And Threadreaper has Cumbersome introduced to support
faster gameplay styles.&r
â€¢ Herald's Cruelty (M4) (Rework) : Quick Charge 2, Piercing 1,
Reverb 3, 20 Projectile Damage, 1.5 Projectile Speed, 18% Magic
Damage
â€¢ Tidebound Arbalest (M4) (Rework) : Quick Charge 3, Multishot,
First Strike 3, Point Blank 3, Retrieval 3, 10 Projectile
Damage, 1 Projectile Speed
â€¢ Witchbane Revolver (M4) : 0 -> 3 Retrieval, 4 -> 3 Quick
Charge, 13 -> 19 Projectile Damage, 0 -> 1 Punch
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : Witchbane Revolver has historically been
unwieldy to use due to its reliance on high speed input, so
we're adjusting it to a slower, and more manageable speed, and
adding some CC control on it to emulate the effective knockback
it had from Quick Charge 4.&r
â€¢ Extinction (M4) : 1 -> 1.1 Attack Speed, 60 -> 70 Unbreaking
â€¢ Covenmourn Rend (M6) : 0 -> 3 Retrieval
â€¢ Fading Horizon (M4) : 3 -> 2 Stamina
&bArchitect's Ring Alchemical Utensils&r
â€¢ &oDeveloper Note : We're adjusting some of the flavour stats
on these alchemist bags, as they were previously rather
uninteresting or hard to make use of (such as Technique on
Amberlight), and some therefore went largely unused.&r
â€¢ Shadebound Satchel (M4) :  0 -> 1 Ice Aspect, 0 -> 1 Melee
Protection, 2.5 -> 3 Knockback Resistance
â€¢ EX Brimstone Alembic (M4) : 0 -> 2 Bleeding, 3 -> 0 Fire
Protection, 0 -> 1 Curse of Anemia
â€¢ Amberlight Vial (M4) : 0 -> 1 Hex Eater, 5 -> 2 Technique,
11.2 -> 12 Potion Damage
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : Hex Eater increases Potion Damage by 0.5
per debuff on hit mobs. Only applies to thrown potions.&r
&bArchitect's Ring Armor&r
â€¢ Fidelis Stella (M4) (Rework) : Guard 1, Sustenance 2, 6 Armor,
+30% Attack Damage
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : The presence of defensive Guard armor
pieces was already dominant with the existence of Blasphemous
Cataphract and Striking Torrent, and while not being good, still
invalidated the niche of the previous iteration of this item.
This iteration hopes to provide a fresh take on the item, being
a Guard item with a sizeable offensive stat with an increased
effective healing.&r
â€¢ Blighted Path (M4) : 1 -> 0 Tempo, 0 -> 2 Sustenance, +15% ->
+20% Projectile Damage
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : It feels like the item does a few too many
different things and spreads itself too thin. Since scouts donâ€™t
have many great sustain options at the minute, and thereâ€™s
already an abundance of choices for Tempo, weâ€™re replacing the
Tempo and redistributing the stats to greater sustainability and
a bit more projectile damage.&râ€¢ Flesh Without Names (M4)
(Rework) : Projectile Protection 2, 10 Agility, +10% Attack
Speed, +10% Magic Damage, 3 Knockback Resistance
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : Flesh Without Names didnâ€™t do well in an
environment already full of solid agility melee protection
helmet options like Stonewrought Helmet and Falling Blades, so
itâ€™s receiving a rework to turn it into a hybrid magic armor
piece akin to Crown of the Rift from the Celsian Isles.&r
â€¢ Godtree Greaves (M4) : 0% -> +15% Speed, 2 -> 1 Regeneration
 &oâ€¢ Weâ€™re giving Godtree Greaves some speed in exchange for a
level of Regeneration to encourage its role as an all-rounder
armor piece.&r
â€¢ Blasphemous Cataphract (M4) : 0 -> 1 Shielding, 1 -> 0 Curse
of Crippling, 2 -> 1 Guard
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : This item from Zenith's release onward has
seen remarkably low usage due to the inconsistency of Guard in
general Region 3 content. We're adding shielding to it to
alleviate some pressure off of Guard to perform, increasing the
item's consistency.&r
â€¢ Footprints Beneath Void (M4) : 6.5 -> 8 Armor, +18% -> +15%
Attack Speed, 3 -> 2 First Strike
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : Footprints lost a significant chunk of its
base armor in the transition to the new evaluation of Attack
Speed. To encourage players to pick it as a more defensive
option over Flight from the Capital, it's getting additional
Armor and reduced Attack Speed.&r
â€¢ Soothing Starblood (M4) : 0% -> +10% Speed, 3 -> 2
Regeneration
â€¢ Aether Threads (M4) : 7.5 -> 8 Agility
â€¢ Lunacrest Solleret (M4) : 7 -> 7.5 Armor
&bArchitect's Ring Shields&r
â€¢ Mycelian Cap (M4) (Rework) : Melee Protection 3, Adrenaline 3,
5.5 Armor, 2 Max Health, +15% Attack Speed
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : Weâ€™re trying a change that makes Mycelian
Cap a solid option in providing a high amount of movement speed
in combat, while being able to support slower attack speed
weapons akin to Remnants of Isharist.&râ€¢ Silver Heart (M4) : 0
-> 2 Stamina, 2 -> 4 Knockback Resistance, 7 -> 6 Armor, 3 -> 2
Magic Protection
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : Silver Heart has remained unremarkable
ever since its release. As such, the shield is receiving Stamina
and a Knockback Resistance buff in order to encourage players to
choose it for its defensive qualities compared to other options,
and will be losing an amount of it to accommodate the increase
in power.&r
â€¢ Defiled Carving (M4) (Rework) : Blast Protection 2, First
Strike 4, 8.5 Agility, +15% Speed
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : Similarly to Silver Heart, this shield has
remained relatively unused outside of certain extremely niche
scenarios. In order to preserve those small use cases and expand
its usage outside of that, its hybrid stats have been converted
into raw First Strike, alongside a sizable speed stat to allow
for faster playstyles.&r
â€¢ Shackled Earth's Boon (M4) : 2 -> 1 Curse of Anemia, +42% ->
+50% Attack Damage, 6.5 -> 5 Agility
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : The previous iteration of Shackled Earth's
Boon boasted a higher attack damage while having an Attack Speed
stat, making it strong offensively but quite unwieldy with its
Curse of Anemia. We're increasing the damage stat on the shield
while reducing the Anemia level to increase its staying power in
long-drawn out fights, and to solidify its position as a heavily
offense-oriented shield.&r
â€¢ EX Tlaxan Bulwark (M4) : 2 -> 4 Sustenance, 5.5 -> 6 Armor,
+20% -> +15% Max Health, +2 -> 0 Max Health
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : This shield's main niche was to provide a
large boost to maximum health and healing, but the cost of using
it outweighed the benefits. As such we're giving it an increased
effective healing through a Sustenance increase, while still
having enough Max Health to pair with other -Max Health items
such as Agaric Abhorrence, with the combo still reaching 18 Max
HP.
&b&rArchitect's Ring Charms&r
â€¢ Parasomnic Remnant : +80% -> ðŸ”’ +125% Deadly Ronde Damage
â€¢ Silvari Blade Handle : 0 -> ðŸ”’ 0.5 Blade Dance Resistance
Duration, +50% -> +75% Blade Dance Damage, 3 -> 4 Charm Power
â€¢ Rusted Bracers : -50% -> -10% Amplifying Hex Damage

Damage

Resistance, 3 -> 2 Projectile Protection

â€¢ Soul of Conflagration : +8% -> +12% Magic Damage
&bKing's Valley Shields&r
â€¢ Magmahide Shield : 0 -> 1 Inferno

â€¢ Soulblighterâ€™s Bulwark : 0 -> 1 Stamina
â€¢ Keeper of the Jungle : 0% -> +8% Attack Speed

-> 12 Projectile Damage,
â€¢ Quetzalcoatlâ€™s Fury : 0 -> 1 Regicide, 0 -> 1 Fire Aspect, 14
-> 13.5 Projectile Damage
â€¢ Ashfloe Chisel : 3 -> 2 Efficiency, 1 -> 3 Unbreaking, 0 -> 1
Mending
â€¢ Spiritspark Flint (Bonecarver) : 3 -> 2 Smite
â€¢ The Ravager : 0 -> 1 First Strike, 2 -> 1 Knockback
â€¢ Lunaticâ€™s Respite : 0 -> 2 First Strike, 2 -> 0 Fire Aspect, 3
-> 2 Knockback, 12.5 -> 11.5 Attack Damageâ€¢ Arachnobane : 1 ->
1.2 Attack Speed, 7.5 -> 8 Attack Damage, 3 -> 2 Slayer
â€¢ Bonepiercer : 12 -> 12.5 Projectile Damage, 0 -> 1 Bleeding
â€¢ Doomâ€™s Edge : 0 -> 2 Decay, 1.7 -> 1.6 Attack Speed
â€¢ Soulcrusher : 0 -> 1 Quake, 13 -> 12.5 Attack Damage
â€¢ Reaperâ€™s Harvest : 4.5 -> 6 Attack Damage, 0 -> 1 Decay, 4 ->
2 Smite
â€¢ Acrid Wrath : 2 -> 1 Knockback
â€¢ Thaumaturgeâ€™s Greed (Divine Thaumaturgeâ€™s Greed) (Rework) : 1
Regicide, 1 Smite, 4 Attack Damage, 4 Attack Speed, +30% Spell
Power
â€¢ Tome of Arcane Horrors (Rework) : Knockback 2, Magic
Protection 2, Ineptitude 2, 8.5 Attack Damage, 1 Attack Speed,
+40% Spell Power
â€¢ Arcane Storm (Rework) : Ice Aspect 1, Sniper 1, 12 Projectile
Damage, 1.5 Projectile Speed
â€¢ Xanatullâ€™s Skystorm (Arcane Snowstorm) (Rework) : Ice Aspect
1, Sniper 1, 13.5 Projectile Damage, 1.5 Projectile Speed, +8%
Magic Damage
â€¢ Sleepwalkerâ€™s Sickle : 0 -> 2 Thunder Aspect, 6 -> 8 Attack
Damage, 2 -> 1.3 Attack Speed
â€¢ Rosethorn Blade (Divine Rosethorn Blade) : 0 -> 1 Life Drain,
6.5 -> 6 Attack Damage, 2.5 -> 0 Agility, 2 -> 3 Thorns
â€¢ Poison Ivy : 0 -> 1 Life Drain, 6 ->  5.5 Attack Damage, 2 ->
0 Agility
â€¢ Soulvenom Bow (Divine Soulvenom Bow) : 0 -> 3 Decay, 16 -> 15
Projectile Damage
â€¢ Telum Immoriel (Ariâ€™s Ionic Buster) : 1 -> 3 Sweeping Edge
â€¢ Willowtwist Wand (Chimarian Wand) (Rework) : Fire Aspect 1,
Earth Aspect 1, 4 Attack Damage, 4 Attack Speed, +30% Spell
Power, +7% Speed
â€¢ Willowtwist Memory (Rework) : Fire Aspect 1, Earth Aspect 1, 5
Attack Damage, 4 Attack Speed, +35% Spell Power, +10% Speed
â€¢ Heatwave (Replica Final Hour) : 14 -> 14.5 Projectile Damage
â€¢ Scattershot Kolotl : 2 -> 0 Punch, 0 -> 1 Point Blank, 14 ->
13.5 Projectile Damage
â€¢ Warforged Crossbow : 3 -> 1 Piercing, 0 -> 1 Quick Charge, 14
-> 13.5 Projectile Damage, 0 -> 1 First Strike, 3 -> 4
Unbreaking
â€¢ Earthbound Runeblade : 0 -> 1 Earth Aspect, 2 -> 1 Armor
â€¢ Seasoaked Runeblade : -10% -> 0% Speed, 1 -> 0 Smite, 0 -> 1
First Strikeâ€¢ Stormborn Runeblade : 0 -> 2 Thunder Aspect, 0 ->
1 Adrenaline, +10% -> 0% Speed, 2 -> 1.8 Attack Speed
â€¢ Lustrous Edge : 6.5 -> 7.5 Attack Damage, 2 -> 3 Thunder
Aspect, 1 -> 0 Fire Aspect, 1.6 -> 1.4 Attack Speed
â€¢ Verminâ€™s End (Rework) : Efficiency 3, Decay 3, Quake 1, 7
Attack Damage, 1.4 Attack Speed
  &oâ€¢ Developer Note : This sword was failing to perform with
its Slayer niche, as it was outclassed by both Corrupted
Geomantic Sword and Arachnidruid Cutlass. This new iteration
gives it a unique spot among swords as a 1.4 Attack Speed sword,
as well as inflicting Decay and spreading it on kill.&r
â€¢ Verminâ€™s Scourge (Rework) : Decay 2, 6.5 Attack Damage, 1.4
Attack Speed
â€¢ Corrupted Watcherâ€™s Sword (Divine Watcherâ€™s Sword) : 3 -> 2
Smite, 0 -> 1 Bleeding, 5.5 -> 6 Attack Damage
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : Corrupted Watcherâ€™s Sword has been the
staple pick for Rogues in the Valley for a long time to come
now, and while there isnâ€™t technically an issue with this, weâ€™d
like to promote weapon diversity by increasing the power level
of other swords while decreasing the power of this one.&r
â€¢ Corrupted Geomantic Dagger : 2 -> 0 Slayer, 0 -> 2 Stamina, 6
-> 7 Attack Damage
â€¢ Geomantic Dagger : 1 -> 0 Slayer, 0 -> 1 Stamina
â€¢ Elemental Wrath (North Pole) : 3.5 -> 4 Attack Damage
â€¢ Heartwood Wand : 1 -> 3 Decayâ€¢ Stiletto of the Summoner
(Rework) : 1 Adrenaline, 1 Fire Aspect, 1 Slayer, +8% Magic
Damage, 5.5 Attack Damage, 1.6 Attack Damage
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : Stiletto's duelist niche, while filling an
empty slot in the region's sword pool, had extremely few use
cases (mostly Snow Spirit), which were made and balanced long
before the item's existence. The item therefore saw remarkably
low usage and was one of those filler pass artifacts people
always turn to fragments. We're trying a new design that caters
to magic-focused Cleric builds, and by extension Shaman, as a
sword alternative to C'Axtal's Crusher, with Fire Aspect to
trigger Inferno and Slayer to assist during Crusade downtime.&r
â€¢ Loci Offering : 6 -> 6.5 Attack Damage, 1 -> 0 Slayer, 0 -> 2
First Strike, 1.6 -> 1.5 Attack Speed
â€¢ Blackroot Branch (Blade of the Lost) : 0 -> 2 Earth Aspect, 0
-> 2 Unbreaking, 9 -> 10 Attack Damage, 1 -> 0 Melee Protection,
1.8 -> 1.5 Attack Speed
â€¢ Pyreborne Spear : 10 -> 17 Projectile Damage, 0 -> 2 Inferno,
4 -> 2 Slayer, 0.8 -> 0.6 Throw Rate
â€¢ Threadwarped Tkaa (Sketched Threadwarped Tkaa) : 11 -> 11.5
Attack Damage
â€¢ Harvestmanâ€™s Scythe (Divine Harvestmanâ€™s Scythe/Dreadful
Harvester) : 0.9 -> 1 Attack Speed
â€¢ Roots' Repose : 5 -> 5.5 Attack Damage
â€¢ Cutting Breeze : 5 -> 5.5 Attack Damage, 7.5% -> 10% Speed
â€¢ Slicing Wind : 5.5 -> 6.5 Attack Damage, 10% -> 15% Speed
&bKing's Valley Alchemical Utensils&r
â€¢ &oDeveloper Note : Many Alchemical Utensils in R1 have
historically been underperforming, especially in the early game,
and had a steep progression that forced players to upgrade their
bags at every dungeon, as well as generally having few enchants
to shape a unique identity.&r
â€¢ Alchemistâ€™s Bag : 2.5 -> 3.5 Potion Damage
â€¢ Soulleather Bag : 3 -> 4 Potion Damage, 0% -> +10% Speed, 5 ->
3 Feather Falling
â€¢ Chimera Maw : 3.5 -> 4 Potion Damage, 0 -> 1 Bleeding
â€¢ Pestilence Vial : 1 -> 2 Decay, 4 -> 3.5 Potion Damageâ€¢
Abnormality should now work if it was obtained a second time
(i.e. from the wheel) before using a previously obtained
Abnormality's Prismatic selection
â€¢ Fixed a slightly misplaced compass waypoint in Sleeping
Shadows
â€¢ Fixed multiple typos in Sleeping Shadows
â€¢ Clarified a task in the quest Sleeping Shadows (hopefully.)
â€¢ You can now get a spare Ornate Spyglass in Sleeping Shadows if
you somehow lose it
â€¢ Fixed an issue where dyes from the respawning chests/barrels
in Sierhaven and the Guild Hub sometimes didn't stack with each
other or even themselves
