â€¢ Silver Heart (M4) : 0 -> 2 Stamina, 2 -> 4 Knockback
Resistance, 7 -> 6 Armor, 3 -> 2 Magic Protection
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : Silver Heart has remained unremarkable
ever since its release. As such, the shield is receiving Stamina
and a Knockback Resistance buff in order to encourage players to
choose it for its defensive qualities compared to other options,
and will be losing an amount of it to accommodate the increase
in power.&r
â€¢ Defiled Carving (M4) (Rework) : Blast Protection 2, First
Strike 4, 8.5 Agility, +15% Speed
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : Similarly to Silver Heart, this shield has
remained relatively unused outside of certain extremely niche
scenarios. In order to preserve those small use cases and expand
its usage outside of that, its hybrid stats have been converted
into raw First Strike, alongside a sizable speed stat to allow
for faster playstyles.&r
â€¢ Shackled Earth's Boon (M4) : 2 -> 1 Curse of Anemia, +42% ->
+50% Attack Damage, 6.5 -> 5 Agility
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : The previous iteration of Shackled Earth's
Boon boasted a higher attack damage while having an Attack Speed
stat, making it strong offensively but quite unwieldy with its
Curse of Anemia. We're increasing the damage stat on the shield
while reducing the Anemia level to increase its staying power in
long-drawn out fights, and to solidify its position as a heavily
offense-oriented shield.&r
â€¢ EX Tlaxan Bulwark (M4) : 2 -> 4 Sustenance, 5.5 -> 6 Armor,
+20% -> +15% Max Health, +2 -> 0 Max Health
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : This shield's main niche was to provide a
large boost to maximum health and healing, but the cost of using
it outweighed the benefits. As such we're giving it an increased
effective healing through a Sustenance increase, while still
having enough Max Health to pair with other -Max Health items
such as Agaric Abhorrence, with the combo still reaching 18 Max
HP.

â€¢ Verminâ€™s End (Rework) : Efficiency 3, Decay 3, Quake 1, 7
Attack Damage, 1.4 Attack Speed
  &oâ€¢ Developer Note : This sword was failing to perform with
its Slayer niche, as it was outclassed by both Corrupted
Geomantic Sword and Arachnidruid Cutlass. This new iteration
gives it a unique spot among swords as a 1.4 Attack Speed sword,
as well as inflicting Decay and spreading it on kill.&r

Attack Speed
â€¢ Corrupted Watcherâ€™s Sword (Divine Watcherâ€™s Sword) : 3 -> 2

 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : Corrupted Watcherâ€™s Sword has been the
staple pick for Rogues in the Valley for a long time to come
now, and while there isnâ€™t technically an issue with this, weâ€™d
like to promote weapon diversity by increasing the power level
of other swords while decreasing the power of this one.&r
â€¢ Corrupted Geomantic Dagger : 2 -> 0 Slayer, 0 -> 2 Stamina, 6
-> 7 Attack Damage
â€¢ Geomantic Dagger : 1 -> 0 Slayer, 0 -> 1 Stamina

â€¢ Heartwood Wand : 1 -> 3 Decayâ€¢ Stiletto of the Summoner
(Rework) : 1 Adrenaline, 1 Fire Aspect, 1 Slayer, +8% Magic
Damage, 5.5 Attack Damage, 1.6 Attack Damage
 &oâ€¢ Developer Note : Stiletto's duelist niche, while filling an
empty slot in the region's sword pool, had extremely few use
cases (mostly Snow Spirit), which were made and balanced long
before the item's existence. The item therefore saw remarkably
low usage and was one of those filler pass artifacts people
always turn to fragments. We're trying a new design that caters
to magic-focused Cleric builds, and by extension Shaman, as a
sword alternative to C'Axtal's Crusher, with Fire Aspect to
trigger Inferno and Slayer to assist during Crusade downtime.&r
â€¢ Loci Offering : 6 -> 6.5 Attack Damage, 1 -> 0 Slayer, 0 -> 2
First Strike, 1.6 -> 1.5 Attack Speed
â€¢ Blackroot Branch (Blade of the Lost) : 0 -> 2 Earth Aspect, 0

1.8 -> 1.5 Attack Speed

4 -> 2 Slayer, 0.8 -> 0.6 Throw Rate
â€¢ Threadwarped Tkaa (Sketched Threadwarped Tkaa) : 11 -> 11.5

Harvester) : 0.9 -> 1 Attack Speed

â€¢ Slicing Wind : 5.5 -> 6.5 Attack Damage, 10% -> 15% Speed
&bKing's Valley Alchemical Utensils&r
â€¢ &oDeveloper Note : Many Alchemical Utensils in R1 have
historically been underperforming, especially in the early game,
and had a steep progression that forced players to upgrade their
bags at every dungeon, as well as generally having few enchants
to shape a unique identity.&r
â€¢ Alchemistâ€™s Bag : 2.5 -> 3.5 Potion Damage
â€¢ Soulleather Bag : 3 -> 4 Potion Damage, 0% -> +10% Speed, 5 ->
3 Feather Falling
â€¢ Chimera Maw : 3.5 -> 4 Potion Damage, 0 -> 1 Bleeding
â€¢ Pestilence Vial : 1 -> 2 Decay, 4 -> 3.5 Potion Damageâ€¢
Abnormality should now work if it was obtained a second time
(i.e. from the wheel) before using a previously obtained
Abnormality's Prismatic selection
â€¢ Fixed a slightly misplaced compass waypoint in Sleeping
Shadows
â€¢ Fixed multiple typos in Sleeping Shadows
â€¢ Clarified a task in the quest Sleeping Shadows (hopefully.)
â€¢ You can now get a spare Ornate Spyglass in Sleeping Shadows if
you somehow lose it
â€¢ Fixed an issue where dyes from the respawning chests/barrels
in Sierhaven and the Guild Hub sometimes didn't stack with each
other or even themselves
