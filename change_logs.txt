For the update on May 23, 2024
&bMinor New Features:&r
• Added a Discovery to the Celsian Isles
• Ability cooldowns are now handled every 5 ticks instead of
every 10 ticks. This means that ability cooldowns will be more
accurate in general, reducing issues such as:

reduction having no effect on certain abilities
  • Abilities taking shorter or longer time to refresh than
usual in certain circumstances

64 per trade.

this.

When joining an overworld or plots shard, a chat message will
pop-up if you have claimable/expired listings, telling you so.
