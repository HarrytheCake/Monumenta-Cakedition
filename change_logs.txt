&b(10.27.0)&r
For the update on March 14, 2024
&bMinor New Features:&r
• A new race has been added to Frostgate! Help make deliveries
across town for a chance at the top of the leaderboard and a
special reward
• CoreProtect now displays lore, durability and container info
for items
• The Masterwork GUI now shows you what stats your item gains
from each Masterwork level
• The Masterwork, Infusion, and Delve Infusion GUIs now show the
actual item instead of placeholders
• Added command /effectlist, which sends the full list of active
custom effects (not including absorption, gallery effects, etc.)
in chat. Hovering over an effect shows its debug information:
the "source" which is an (usually somewhat descriptive) string
specific to whatever applied the effect, the "ID" which is the
name of the type of effect, the duration in ticks, and the
"magnitude" which is a (sometimes unused or meaningless) number
that represents how potent the effect is. While this command can
be useful for finding or verifying bugs, please do _not_ report
any "inconsistencies" with the source or ID strings, as they are
purely for backend and debug purposes.

has been re-enabled, and the refund trade for it has been
