In many cases, this was the most optimal damage setup. As a
consequence, this made most fast attack speed weapons suboptimal
because it was not possible to stack enough attack damage to
outdo the gains slow weapons with attack speed gear received.
Most item changes this balance update attempt to fix this issue,
and the following is a summary of changes:
• Flat attack speed has been removed and replaced with percent
attack speed on most gear pieces
• Percent attack speed or other stats have been reduced on most
pieces of gear with percent attack speed
• Many slow attack speed weapons have received buffs to their
damage to compensate for the loss of flat attack speed and
overall reduction in attack speed gear
### Class Changes:
Scorched Earth : The damage and effects of a Scorched Earth zone
can only be applied to mobs within it once every two game ticks
• &oDeveloper Note: Scorched Earth is a unique skill with high
highs and low lows. For optimal output, it requires precise
positioning and coordination with a group of players to get the
full effects of the skill. In situations where mobs are
guaranteed to stay in one area, the difficulty to achieve
optimal damage is trivial and its potentially uncapped damage
led to meta centrallizing strategies. This change aims to
maintain its power level in solo play (as it is close to
impossible to hit mobs with enough damage to hit the 2 tick cap
consistently) while capping its damage potential in the best
case circumstances.&rLuminous Infusion has received a rework:
• L1: Performing a critical melee attack against an enemy grants
1 stack of Luminosity capped at 6 stacks. Right click while not
sneaking or holding usable items to prime one stack of
Luminosity, or all stacks while looking down. All stacks unprime
after 4s. With two or more primed stacks, the next attack or
ability against an undead enemy is infused with explosive power
that deals 2 magic damage per stack to it and other undead
enemies, or half damage against non-undead, in a 0.33 blocks per
stack radius around it and knocking other enemies away from it.
Gain 1 stack of Luminosity every 0.5s if you haven't triggered
an explosion in 9s and have no primed stacks.
• L2: Luminosity stacks up to 12 times. With at least one primed
stack, the next critical melee attack against an undead enemy
triggers Divine Justice for 20% of your critical attack damage.
Undead enemies hit by this ability are set on fire for 3s.
• To accommodate this change, the default trigger for Hand of
Light has been moved to right click while sneaking
• &oDeveloper Note: Cleric has received a series of nerfs in
recent months that have harmed Paladin's game loop while we
tried to address balance issues with Hierophant. This rework
attempts to do the following:&r
  • &oImprove Paladin's damage consistency in melee and magic&r
  • &oEmphasize the strengths of Paladin's playstyle while
retaining the skill's usability in any situation&r
  • &oMove away from Paladin's current tendency to cast every
skill off cooldown and finish off with Luminous. This playstyle
is too close to Reaper in execution and outcome and leads to
issues with class identity.&r
&oDue to time constraints, other skill changes intended to
further improve Paladin were not able to be shipped with this
update. This is a significant shift from Paladin's current
design; nevertheless we hope Paladin players will enjoy this
faster paced iteration of the skill and look forward to future
improvements.&r• Lesser Divine Flare Charm : +10% Luminous

&b1.20.4 • Content Freeze&r
We are starting the process of updating Minecraft to 1.20.4. We
begin by upgrading the internal development server to 1.20.4 and
doing more intensive testing. Once we are confident that most
critical bugs are fixed, the play server will also be upgraded.
During this time, our ability to release new content will be
diminished. We won't be running weekly updates until the end of
the freeze. Critical bug fixes will still be shipped. Changes
will still occur during this time, but they will target 1.20.4
and ship after we upgrade the play server.
TL;DR: No new changes will happen for the next few weeks, then
play will be upgraded to 1.20.4 with a big changelog.
&bImportant:&r
• The player market has been locked following this week's
update. In order to unlock your shop talk to the shop shulker
and select `I want to unlock this shop`.
• The City of Shifting Waters is still bugged. Players are
advised to complete the dungeon in a single sitting to avoid
instance corruption.
