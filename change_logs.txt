### Rush of Dissonance
&oThe nexus stirs once more...&r
•
&bRush of Dissonance has completely been reworked!&r Featuring
the same premise but with a new pace!
• The arena has been rebuilt! It is larger in size and each of
the four seasons feature their own environmental hazards. The
new nexus now supports up to four players!
• The influence from the Dissonance realm has forced the
denizens to undergo changes. Familiar faces and new foes now
occupy the nexus, with their numbers larger than ever.
• Progression is done by rounds. Each round consists of four
waves, with the last having greater count than the rest. Trades
and advancements are unlocked by rounds.
• The Dissonant Spirit offers additional trades for those who
stand their ground long enough...
-# Remnant of the Rose usage from the previous iteration is
kept.### Seasonal Pass
• We hoped you enjoyed the mechanical theme featured in the
previous Seasonal Pass! We're sure all of the sounds of
mechanical whirring and gears turning started to get old after a
while. Now, we have a brand new Seasonal Pass, corresponding
with the brand-new Rush of Dissonance rework: The
&bPass of Dissonance&r, featuring cosmetics and builds related
to Harmony and Dissonance!
• Unlock brand new Titles, Mob Dummies, Elite Finishers, and
other rewards as you progress through the usual 13 weeks of pass
missions. Additionally, we have introduced five brand-new extra
tiers to the rewards track, containing extra tokens as a reward
for those who continue completing missions!
• One new Seasonal Pass Artifact has been added to the Relic
Wheel pool! A second one may be coming within the next few
weeks.
• The Seasonal Pass GUI has been slightly reworked, specifically
under the Rewards tab, to improve organization and allow support
for the new tier count in this Seasonal Pass.
• Due to a mistake when setting up the Marsh Madness Pass, every
monthly mission since then has been considered a "Bonus"
mission, making it easier to get the Tryhard title.
Unfortunately, this change was unintentional. To fix this
problem without being too punishing, we have decided to meet in
the middle • the third monthly mission, on Weeks 9 to 12, will
remain as a Bonus mission, while the other two will not.
• Head to the Seasonal Pass Lobby to start your new adventure,
in celebration of the new Rush of Dissonance!
&bHotfix 11.39.1 (for daily restart):&r
• Fixed rush memory leak
