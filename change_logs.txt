### Phyrrys, City of Fallen Stars

released! Uncover the secrets of a fractured city, find your way
to the very bottom of the sealed Locus Tower and claim the
Indigo Wool!

Enjoy!
### Major New Features:
• A brand new mainline quest has been added •
&bHolding Space&r! Work with your allies to at last seek a way
into Phyrrys, the City of Fallen Stars to claim the Indigo Wool
before Aurora and her team can do so and enact their grand plan!
This quest can be started at Silver Knight Tuulen outside the
Sirius arena, and requires Starriest Night, All That Remains,

an ability cannot be obtained due to having too many active
abilities in its tree already, it will be crossed out in this
display
