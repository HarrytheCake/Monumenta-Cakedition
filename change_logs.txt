### Major New Features:
&bSilver Knight Remnants&r
• A brand new repeatable piece of Overworld content, Silver
Knight Remnants is releasing <t:1740852000:F>!
• A brand new quest,
&bRemnants of the Empire&r, introduces this content, which can
be accessed at the Record-Keeper outside the Chantry of
Repentance with completion of For Whom the Bell Tolls, a win of
Celestial Zenith, and at least one Sirius kill, which will
unlock access to SKRs.
• Play existing Overworld content like PoIs, Strikes, Gallery
maps, and more to occasionally find Remnant Scrolls which can
then be used to access a Silver Knight Remnant room. These can
also be upgraded at the Record-Keeper for longer Sequence
scrolls which require more steps to complete, but offer greater
rewards!
• Once you've gotten a Scroll and have completed the quest,
interact with your Scroll to receive a hint to a Silvergate
you've attuned to. Find that location and you'll enter a brand
new combat encounter to conquer or puzzle encounter to unravel.
• Find rich lore about the Silver Knights of the past and their
hunts for various Wool across the world, in new and familiar
locations.
• Earn incredible rewards, including currency, new items, and
exciting new charms, as well as a brand new utility Artifact,
the Portable Gatecharm.

same command

this command instead
• Added a blocking system

to the existing ignore system that is accessible using `/chat
ignore`

    • `/block remove <player>`

### Minor New Features:
&bCave of Secrets Overhaul&r
Cave of Secrets has been entirely rebuilt from the ground up! In
addition to rebuilding the surrounding overworld, the Poi is now
a T3, has entirely new mobs, and related quest sequences have
been made significantly cooler. Additionally, due to the poi's
size, dying inside Cave of Secrets will respawn you at the
beginning of the Poi rather than Sierhaven.

quest now only requires the Elemental Staff to be in your
inventory, rather than required to be in your mainhand
