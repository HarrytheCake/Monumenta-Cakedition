&b(10.26.0)&r
For the update on March 7, 2024
&bMajor New Features:&r
&bMarket Plugin (Closed Beta)&r
After ~~months~~ years of development, a basic implementation of
the market plugin will finally be released. At <t:1710003600:f>,
the Market will be available to patrons, as well as developers
and moderators. One week later, assuming everything goes well,
it will be available for everyone.
• Why a beta?:
While it may look simple, it is not simple to make sure that
items in the market are safe from both deletion and duplication.
Obviously, we would not be releasing it if we knew of any such
issue, but it is crucial that everything works, so in the case
that something goes wrong, it will affect fewer people.
• What to expect:
The features of the market plugin are intentionally limited.
This iteration contains what is best described as a virtual
bazaar, with a framework for future features. Limiting the
complexity was necessary in order to create a working product
without burning out developers and with less risk of critical
bugs. The goal of this release is to have something that players
could use, and we can add features over time.
• For those who will have access:
Feel free to share what you see/do to other players. Even though
you have access and others don't, there are no secrets or
spoilers, so you can discuss any aspect of it with anyone.
While we want things to go as smoothly as possible, and while
that thing got tested pretty well, we might still encounter some
bugs. As always, report any bugs you see and especially report
any duplication or item-deleting bugs promptly.• What's next:
First of all, we'll address feedback regarding what's currently
implemented. We expect many people will ask for some kind of
filter to avoid looking through pages and pages of items, and
yes, that will be implemented soon. After that, we have many
other features planned, with the ultimate goal being to pretty
much replace current market island. Among other things, that
means different kinds of trading, such as a stock market or
auction house.
&bMinor New Features:&r
• A new race has been added to the Architect’s Ring! Race across
Star Point for a chance at the top of the leaderboard and a
special reward
• Added the `/ping` command, allowing players to check their
ping to the server
• When transferring from a dungeon to an (unspecified) overworld
shard, the shard number will now always be the same for a given
dungeon instance, instead of varying by time. In other
scenarios, there are no changes to shard sorting
• Clicking on ability or level items in the Class Display GUI
now sends the description in chat
• Adjusted enhancement item in Class Display GUI to be more
consistent with the level item
• Key sellers in dungeon lobbies for non-bonus dungeons have
regained their original name of Gatekeeper. The Gatekeepers
located inside of dungeons have been renamed to Dungeon Guards
• All Strikes have received a completion trophy item
• Guild Hall inside the Castle Narsen received a visual update
• Increased the cooldown of certain mobs' rejuvenation spells
that had insanely low cooldown
&bItem Changes:&r
• Poise now provides half the bonus if the player is above 70%
hp
• Inferno scaling per level increased from [Level^0.9] to
[Level^0.95]&nRegion 1 Items:&r
• Ancient Robes : 3 -> 4 Unbreaking
• Serpensia Wrap : 3 -> 4 Unbreaking
• C'Zanil's Shroud : 3 -> 4 Unbreaking
• Stonegazer Eyes : 3 -> 4 Unbreaking
• Alchemist's Insight : 3 -> 4 Unbreaking
• Coldsteel Blunt : 0 -> 2 Unbreaking
• Plague Bearer's Tunic : 2 -> 4 Unbreaking
• Plague Bearer's Soiled Trousers : 2 -> 4 Unbreaking
• Plague Bearer's Boots : 2 -> 4 Unbreaking
&nRegion 2 Items:&r
• Golden Sun Set : Agility -> Armor
• Crown of Flames : 3 -> 4 Unbreaking
• Chillwind Treads : 8 -> 11 Unbreaking
• Robes of the Pharaoh : 8 -> 10 Unbreaking
• Mage Hunter's Mask : 3 -> 4 Unbreaking
• Galemage's Greaves : 2 -> 3 Unbreaking
• Myriad's Embrace : 4 -> 6 Unbreaking
• Spellbinder's Slippers : 8 -> 11 Unbreaking
• Blackthread Boots : 0 -> 2 Unbreaking, 0 -> 1 Depth Strider
• Apotheosis Spear (Thunder) : 0 -> +10% Movement Speed
• Frost Giant's Crusher : 20 -> 21.5 Attack Damage ↑&nRegion 3
Items:&r
• Spring-Loaded Sheath (Rework) : 1 Charm Power, +3 Dagger Throw
Daggers, +10% Dagger Throw Damage, -20% Dagger Throw Range ⟲
Note: &oThe charm didn't provide much upside before, with the
cooldown decrease rendered useless by Vicious Combos, and this
change hopes to make it more appealing in builds.&r
• Six-Pronged Sea Stone : +1 -> +2 Chain Lightning Targets ↑
Note: &oThe enhancement for Chain Lightning has since been
reduced in power, so the charm can afford to be stronger in its
utility.&r
• Silvari Blade Handle : +35% -> +50% Blade Dance Radius, +1.5
-> +1 Blade Dance Root Duration, +35% Blade Dance Cooldown ->
+25% Blade Dance Cooldown ↑
Note: &oSilvari Blade Handle in niche was similar to the
Explosive Razor charm, in which it became essentially near
useless to run the former before these stat changes.&r
• Echo of the Beast : 5 -> 4 Charm Power, +25% -> +10% Bodkin
Blitz Distance ↑
Note: &oEcho is getting a charm power decrease, seeing as it's
harder to fit into builds, and also doesn't provide enough
benefit for its high cost.&r
• Urn of Perpetuity : -70% -> -90% Blizzard Damage ↓
• Explosive Charm of Snowfall : +10% -> 0% Blizzard Damage ↓
Note: &oBlizzard Specialisation charms paired with Urn of
Perpetuity were performing better than intended, and encouraged
spawner-rushing playstyles and AFK gameplay.&r
• Chaos Codex : -60% -> -40% Voodoo Bonds Received Damage ↓
Note: &oWhile Chaos Codex is quite niche, the penalty for using
it currently isn't large enough for what it provides in a team
setting, so the DR increase is getting reduced to compensate.&r
• Everflow Pendant : 0% -> -30% Blade Dance Radius ↓
• Aether Edge : +200% -> +100% Deadly Ronde Angle ↓
Note: &oThese charms paired cause Deadly Ronde and Blade Dance
to become almost full 360 degree AOE damage coverage around the
player, so they're getting nerfed down to be more reasonably in
line with the other classes.&r• Lesser Charm of Insight: 1 -> 2
Charm Power ↓
Note: &oBottled Font of Tuulen's downside is largely countered
by this lesser charm, so it's becoming slightly more expensive
as a result.&r
• Abyssal Truncheon (Rework) : Riptide 2, Magic Protection 1,
Technique 3, 17 Attack Damage, 1.3 Attack Speed ⟲
Note: &oThis item has been underperforming since its release, so
it's undergoing an experimental change to see how it fares.&r
• Blasphemous Cataphract (Rework) : Guard 2, Curse of Crippling
1, 7 Armor, 7 Knockback Resistance ⟲
Note : &oAs an item with both offense and defense, it struggled
with spreading its stats too thin, so it's shifting to a
completely defensive item.&r
• Thalassic Cinders (M4) : 1 -> 0 Curse of Crippling, 75% -> 70%
Spell Power ↑
Note: &oMoving the damage decrease from crippling to spell power
instead removes the damage penalty from being at the Second Wind
threshold, and is a general buff to spell power as well&r
• Argentum Arbitrium (M4) : 2 -> 1 Curse of Anemia, 7 -> 6.5
Agility ↑
Note: &oArgentum Arbitrium in the context of Agility offhands
didn't perform so well after it received anemia, so we're
reverting the change.&r
• Norvigut Skewer (M4) : 1 -> 2 First Strike ↑
• Resonant Scythe (M4) : 13.5 -> 14 Attack Damage ↑
• Epoch Hammer (M4) : 2 -> 1 Adrenaline ↓
• Copper Furnace (Replacement): Copper Relay Unit: 2 Charm
Power, +2.5 Restless Souls Debuff Radius, +2.5 Restless Souls
Debuff Duration, -10% Restless Souls Damage
• Molldyer's Inferno (Replacement): Hexcrafted Siphon: 1 Charm
Power, -15% Amplifying Hex Enhancement Health Threshold, +10%
Amplifying Hex Enhancement Damage Bonus
Note: &oCopper Furnace has been a repeatedly-problematic charm
and Molldyer's Inferno has had an underwhelming presence for one
of Warlock's epic charms. We're taking this opportunity to
rework both charms and introduce new stats for players to
experiment with.&rBoth charms will automatically be replaced
into their new versions after the update. For Molldyer's
Inferno, since it is an epic charm, there will be a trade at
Ageratina to refund Hexcrafted Siphons in exchange for HAR and
blue mats
&bfor this week only&r. The epic purchase message for Hexcrafted
Siphon will also be disabled for this week only to prevent
abusing the refunds.
&bClass Changes:&r
• Swapping off of your weapon during Stealth early no longer
inflicts Mining Fatigue on the player, and now simply just
removes the stealth.
• Shield Wall: Now follows the user continuously instead of
remaining in one place. The following additional changes and
adjustments were made to enable this change and make it feel
more consistent.

it is at the time for the remainder of the duration

which is disabled by default

second) but can still only be damaged once they have exited and
reentered the hitbox
 • Slightly reduced vertical knockback
 • Slightly reduced hitbox size
 • Mobs that manage to stay within the hitbox of the wall are no
longer given slowness, as it is much more common for mobs that
don't have high amounts of KBR to do this
 • Reworked particles (including Prestigious Shield) to have
clarity when moving
&bFeedback Fixes:&r
• The Experience Flask is now rewarded for the completion of
Supply and Demand, giving new players access to this QoL item
much earlier into the game. Likewise, the Experience Flask's
repurchase value at the Royal Spellbinders has been
significantly reduced.

Concentrated Experience rather than 96 Experience Bottles

Depths lobby for consistency
