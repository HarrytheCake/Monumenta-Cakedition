• Lightbringer : 8 -> 6 Attack Damage, 1.1 -> 1 Attack Speed
  • &oDeveloper Note: Lightbringer is both a melee and
projectile damage trident. With the proper set of gear and
skills (either by running Cleric or Melee Scout), Lightbringer
was able to substantially outclass Corrupted Watcher's Sword in
what should be CWatcher's niche of undead melee DPS. These
changes leave its strong projectile capabilities alone while
making it less potent as a melee undead weapon.&r
• Ashes of Eternity has received a partial rework:
 • &oApplies the effect of Resurrection upon death while holding
in mainhand. When a player triggers this effect, the enchant is
marked as \"Used\" and becomes unusable to them until the next
new day. The enchant is refreshed and mark is removed when
clicking with the item in mainhand, if a new day has occurred
since last use.&r
&bClass Changes:&r
• Divine Justice: Level 2 damage decreased from 5 + 25% damage
to 5 + 20% damage. Enhancement decreased from 5% damage per
stack, capped at 40%, to 4% damage per stack, capped at 32%.
• Illuminate: Enhancement now deals damage every 2 seconds,
instead of every 0.5 seconds.
• Glorious Battle: Pierce damage now only hits the first 3 mobs
you collide with while charging.
• Cloak and Dagger : Damage from this skill no longer counts
towards its boss damage thresholds for cloak stack gain
• Sharpshooter : Due to a bug we did not catch until after the
release of Additive, Sharpshooter's 25% base and 4% projectile
damage per stack were not updated to 30% and 5%, respectively as
listed in the changelogs. After allowing the changes to settle
for a few weeks, we have decided to keep the current values in
place
