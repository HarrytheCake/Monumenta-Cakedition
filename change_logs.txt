&b(10.50.0)&r
For the update on August 22, 2024
&bMajor New Features:&r
• The Battlefield east of Nyr has been completely revamped!
Along with the Ruined Mansion POI, the sorrounding overworld has
recieved some additions and visual overhauls, such as the Winds
of War Vault, Murky Maze POI, and more.
• Migrated our server proxies from Bungeecord to Velocity. If
this causes any issues, please report it in
<#569283558741508107>!
• Migrated our tablist plugin from BTLP to a combination of TAB
and the Monumenta plugin. Once again, report any strange
behavior to <#569283558741508107>!
&bMinor New Features:&r
• Players will now be sent to the shard's sort box when
abandoning or being kicked from a dungeon instance
• The invisible glowing slime in Depths/Zenith ability/upgrade
reward chests has been replaced by a gold block which glows only
for players who have unclaimed rewards. Additionally, it now
persists until a new one is spawned, instead of lasting a set
amount of time
• You can now preview a Celestial Gem upgrade by swapping hands
on a Zenith Charm while a Celestial Gem is in your inventory
• Chests in strikes can now also be collected via left-clicks,
which prevents accidentally breaking them
• Spoiler for Hekawt: ||There is now a fake victory message
after Hekawt dies for the first time for players who have not
yet defeated the boss||
• Antidote now uses a custom effect to clear poison, and also
grants immunity to poison for a short while
• Following the 5.1.0 Resource Pack update, twelve new Hope
Skins have been added to Mastersmith Antonio's shop! Thank you
very much to our Patrons for your continued support!
• A new discovery has been added to the King's Valley.
&bFeedback Fixes:&r
• Custom respawn points in R3 POIs are now respected if they are
within the same POI that you died in. Conquering a POI resets
your respawn point if set within the POI to prevent respawning
inside a POI when dying outside of one.
• Cyan Tess now remembers in which direction you were looking
when you set your respawn point
• POIs will now only respawn 10 seconds after the last player
leaves instead of immediately
• Boats that a player is riding no longer get deleted when a POI
respawns with the player in it
• Item selling stations, fragging stations, and
ticketing/tokenisation stations now work similar to
Experiencinators/Crystallizers and will thus no longer sell or
frag infused items or items not at base masterwork level
• Added stairs to a front door in Suspicious Village
• The buttons in the yellow puzzle of the Primeval Creations
series have been replaced with remote click detection to tidy up
the puzzle
• Jar of Clucks no longer provides healing, and thus Heavenly
Boon will no longer spread it in a large area
• Clucking noises are now only audible to the cursed player and
play slightly randomly (are you sure there's a chicken? must be
your imagination)
• If already Clucked, no additional pieces of gear will be
Clucked
• Divine Justice enhancement damage is now displayed as stacks
in the ability display of the Unofficial Monumenta Mod
• Fixed Divine Justice enhancement damage disappearing for a
fraction of a second when it loses a stack
• Purified Ash drops from Divine Justice enhancement are now
easier to pick up
• Improved  `/ping`  command accuracy
&bMob/Boss Changes:&r
• The Block Breaking boss/mob spell has received a significant
rework:
  • Improved sounds and particles when blocks are broken
  • Mobs will try to avoid breaking blocks excessively when
digging upwards towards a player
  • Most mobs that break blocks now use one spell instead of
multiple implementations with similar functionality
  • The performance of the spell has been significantly
increased which should reduce lag spikes when a mob breaks a
large amount of blocks in one tick
  • Block breakers are now more aggressive in breaking blocks
that prevent pathfinding or slow them
• Twisteds (and other mobs that place blocks) have received a
significant rework to block placing logic:
  • Added slight variation to block placing sounds
  • Fixed a bug where the mob wouldn't place blocks in many
valid locations
  • The code now uses the updated block breaking spell instead
of an outdated, hardcoded version
  • Increased the leniency of the bridging algorithm's height
difference calculations. The target player can jump normally and
stand on slightly elevated ground without the mob attempting to
place blocks
  • The bridging algorithm no longer places blocks inside the
mob which should reduce instances of it getting stuck
  • Improved detection and handling for the mob getting stuck in
placed blocks
  • The performance of the spell has been significantly
increased
• Kaul and Primordial/Immortal Elemental now glow permanently
• Sirius' impact can now be felt in your bones (and ears)

colours being overridden by player abilities like Eagle Eye

• Fixed stacked grass in Orange & Ex Orange
• Fixed completing SR parkour putting you one block into the
ground
• Fixed the Player Stats GUI not properly calculating reduced
damage dealt due to region scaling and shattered items
• Fixed plots counting as both isles and ring for items when
using `/plot region ring`, preventing proper testing of isles
equipment and also displaying wrong values in the Player Stats
GUI (this used to be necessary for isles equipment to _mostly_
work before `/plot region` was added). To restore the old
behaviour, use the new `/plot region all`.
• Fixed Chaotic generating errors in logs every time it dealt
negative damage
• Fixed an issue with the hint for Forsworn Sanctum's ||Three is
Key secret||• Fixed some mobs, including most iron golems, not
properly being counted as hostile immediately when spawned,

Scrolls
