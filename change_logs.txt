wrong dungeons entirely.

&b(11.8.0)&r
For the update on March 19, 2025
### Major New Feature:
&bDiamenean Hunts&r
• 6 new bosses will appear periodically in the Architect's Ring
overworld at specific locations, the first one spawning at
<t:1742673600:F> (note the later than usual release time). There
is a randomized time between each spawn, with an average
duration of 2 hours.
• Starting right after the update, you can talk to veteran
hunters at the Lodge near Galengarde to learn about each of the
quarries and get tips on how to fight them. Talk to Retneau to
begin your initiation. There are no prerequisites other than
being in Region 3.
• In particular, the most important information to learn from
the veteran hunters is each quarry's &obanish&r and &ospoil&r
mechanics
  • Each quarry will have some way to &obanish&r you from the
fight, leaving you safe back at the lodge, but without any
chance to defeat the boss
  • Each quarry has valuable but fragile loot. If you don't hunt
it carefully, you could &ospoil&r the loot, significantly
reducing the yield you get upon victory
• 15 and 5 minutes before a quarry spawns, players who have been
initiated at the lodge will receive announcements in chat,
including which ring shard the fight will occur on and a hint
for the location where the boss will spawn
• If many players are at the hunt when the quarry appears, some
will be transferred to a different shard where another copy of
the boss will spawn. If possible, members of the same guild will
be kept together when this happens
• Players who arrive late to a hunt will not be able to get any
loot and will get shattered and lose experience if they die
(players who are not late will not be shattered or lose
experience when dying in a hunt)### Minor New Features:
• A new Keep-biome puzzle room has been added to the Silver
Knight Remnants
• Added two new Keep SKR rooms, one normal combat and one long
• Block placing mobs will no longer place blocks if there are
players within a small radius around them
• `/friend` and `/block` now show players on other shards
• Some mushrooms just outside of Galengarde have become extra
bouncy
• Added a few new waterpools near the Blue overworld teleporter
• Added some puddles of rainfall in a few trees & roofs around
Galengarde
• Split the weapon enchantment section of the handbook into 2
rows, one of which contains all aspect enchantments and Decay
and Bleeding (which function exactly like aspects) and the other
row contains everything else
• The Winter event has ended. Thanks for enjoying the late
festivities this year! Essences of Winter will no longer be
found across Monumenta. Adding Festive to items and Selholly
Sprignos's event trades have been disabled. The Snowball
Launcher remains functional.
• The Valentines event has ended. The maze is now no longer
accessible, and the Replica Cupid's Bow is not obtainable...
until next year, I suppose?
•
&bNew Experimental Delve Modifier&r • Rot (3 pts / level,
available for the next 2 weeks)
  • Level 1: Saturation no longer heals
   • Level 2: And healing is cut by 30%
