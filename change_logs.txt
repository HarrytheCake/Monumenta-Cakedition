For the update on May 30, 2024
&bSilver Skinned&r
Continuing our aim of 2024 to wrap out lingering Region 2 quest
lines, a new quest has come to the Celsian Isles • Silver
Skinned! This quest serves as both the finale to the Shifting
City story, and as an epilogue to the region's mainline/Parting
Veil plot.
Join back together with Fred as you embark on one last bizarre
adventure, solving lingering questions about the city's history
as you follow the trails of the past.
To begin Silver Skinned, you may speak to the Fred fish in
Breachpoint, after having completed The Stone Ocean, A Lich in
the System, The Tomb of Time, and Scientists of Steelmeld II.

trade

Waters, players who have all the necessary requirements to start
The Stone Ocean, minus a Shifting completion, may now obtain one
via Chuck in Sierhaven. Unlike Chuck's other trades, this one is
temporary and will be removed when the technical issues are
resolved.

movement abilities but no longer give resistance
