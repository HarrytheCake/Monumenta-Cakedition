&bMonumenta: Runestones&r • Update 0.2
Welcome to Monumenta: Runestones' first major update! We'll be
primarily keeping change notes and information to the
<#1354661850498994196> thread, but as this is the first update,
I wanted to share it here. For those out of the know, Runestones
is our Monumenta themed Card Game that soft-launched in Alpha
last month.
We've made some adjustments to the rule book following a month
of open testing, some changes to cards to make them more fun and
useful, begun adding card art, and added a big package of new
cards! If you'd like to see more details, with the full
changelog, how to play, and how to view all the new and updated
cards, please visit and follow the Runestones thread linked
above.

through random ticks or bonemeal

Mourning

• Added a new Zenith F1 Normal room from Qweun
• Added a new Zenith F2 Elite room from Nyaalma
• We've added extra protections against vanilla villager trades
appearing (anything with vanilla emeralds), and as such we're

5% damage per stack
• Arcanic: Arcanic Missile damage reduced from 12/30/40 to
12/25/35
• Transcendent: Transcendent Missile knockback now respects KBR
### Depths & Zenith Changes:
This round of balance updates has two main goals: Firstly, to
rework spawner break abilities which as a whole have had several
negative effects on gameplay. Secondly, to improve the early run
experience, particularly in Zenith. Several abilities have been
significantly reworked, so let us know how they feel and expect
a round of follow up changes as we gather data.
• Wand Aspect no longer makes your first three ability
selections a guaranteed trigger slot. This feature is now a
default to the entire content.
• The starting random ability for each player has been replaced
by an ability selection.
• Wand Aspect now only amplifies magic damage with spell power.
• Sidearm, Scrapshot and Firework Blast have had their damage
increased slightly to compensate (see misc. changes for numbers)
• Hubris logout effect no longer depends on current death timer
and should respond more fairly.&oCallicarpa Changes&r
The following changes to Callicarpa should make her more
consistent on elite summons and less of a wall at high
ascensions, hopefully opening up runs to be viable even if
players don't hit everything in the first few rooms.
• Plant spawn rate reduced by 25%.
• No longer passively spawns mobs. Now summons a set of mobs in
the center of the arena at specific health breakpoints.
&oSpawner Break Changes&r
• Spawner break trigger converted to new "wildcard action"
trigger.
• All wildcard passive abilities are now eligible for single
ability charms. Add cooldown charm effect where applicable
• Lightning Bottle and Rapid Fire now occupy this trigger for
their respective trees.
• Sundrops has moved to a passive slot.
&oFlame Spirit&r
• Trigger changed to: summons spirit at the closest enemy hit
when dealing damage to three or more enemies at once.
• Cooldown: 12s
• Duration doubled from 3s to 6s
• Damage roughly halved
&oPhantom Force&r
• Trigger changed to: on elite kill
• The vexes now hover near a nearby target which can be attacked
to explode nearby vexes, dealing damage and applying
vulnerability in a small aoe

• Cooldown: 5s
&oPermafrost&r
• Trigger changed to: left click when not sneaking
• Gain up to three charges, each by killing three mobs.

vulnerability to the enemy, only you deal 10-22% (scales) more
damage to them for 3s.
• Twisted packed ice effect removed.
• Charm effects:
  • Ice Bonus Duration -> Debuff Duration
  • Trail Duration -> Slowness Amplifier
  • Ice Duration -> Vuln Amplifier
&oWhirlwind&r
• Trigger changed to: when airborne for more than 0.75s
• Cooldown: 15s
• Instead of knockback, now reduces the next casted ability's
cooldown by 5-15% (scales) after casting. Still applies speed
• Radius charms are now cooldown, knockback charm effect
replaced with cdr effect.&oEntrench&r
• Trigger changed to: when blocking a melee attack via shield or
absorption
• Cooldown: 18s
• Now roots the area around attacking mob instead of the spawner
location
• Applies brittle effect to non-boss enemies rooted for
1.5-2.5s. The next time they are melee attacked, they are
knocked back in the direction hit, bypassing CC immunity.
• Root now bypasses cc immunity for non-boss enemies
• Works with any shield, taunt, dawn abils, etc
&oPrecision Strike&r
• Removed, charms converted to other steel effects:
• Damage -> Rapid Fire Damage
• Range -> Split Arrow Range
• Max Stacks -> Sharpshooter Max Stacks
&oConvergence&r
• Reworked: Now allows you to hold multiple wildcard trigger
abilities (amount scaling with rarity), which display in the
passive section and can’t be removed as an active. Removing
Convergence also removes held wildcard trigger abilities.
&oMisc Balance&r
• Ice Barrier Cooldown: 12s -> 14-8s (scales)
• Sidearm Damage: 12-24 -> 15-27
