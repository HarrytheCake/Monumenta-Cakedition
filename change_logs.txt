• A new NPC has been added to the Black Mist, the Ghostly
Shantyman. Interacting with him allows you to hear a new music
track if you have the Monumenta Music pack (see the
<#746440233368682566> channel for information on how to download
and install the pack), called The Parting Veil, written and
performed by Fangride.
&bDepths/Zenith Ability Trigger Customization:&r
• There is now a button to open the ability trigger
customization GUI in the Depths/Zenith ability summary GUI. In
this GUI, individual abilities' triggers and key options can be
customized as expected.
• Customizations to a given ability do not transfer to other
abilities that share the same trigger by default, and
customizations are kept between runs.
• All Depths/Zenith abilities remain only castable with melee
and projectile weapons and tools, and the default options for
each ability apply further restrictions equivalent to the
current restrictions for that trigger.
• There is no effect on what slot an ability occupies and the
summary GUI and ability descriptions will always refer to the
slots by their default trigger.
&bZenith Balance Changes:&r
• 4 and 5 charm power Zenith charms have had their budget
increased. Wildcard charm types have had their budget slightly
increased. Existing charms may gain additional positive effects
to reflect this!
• Diversity will now give you a Prismatic selection instead of a
random one ↑
• Earthen Wrath cooldown now begins after the effect is over,
instead of at the start of cast. Damage reflected (before
multipliers) is capped at 160 (240 in Zenith). 30s -> 24s
Cooldown. ↓

expanded its hitbox vertically
&bItem Changes:&r

&bSeasonal Pass:&r
After a rush of releases for Star Point, we bring you a fairly
straightforward seasonal pass, the Coin Rush pass! This pass is
largely to both help catch up on artifacts and other rewards for
players and decrease the workload on plugin development/builders
this pass that was focused elsewhere.• Changes to Zenith Charms
retroactively did not update this week due a bug, we are
investigating but won't be able to fix until next week as we
can't rerun the weekly update. New charms dropped from today
will benefit from the increased charm budget
&bImportant:&r
• The player market has been locked following this week's
update. In order to unlock your shop talk to the shop shulker
and select `I want to unlock this shop`.
• The City of Shifting Waters is still bugged. Players are
advised to complete the dungeon in a single sitting to avoid
instance corruption.
• The Plunderer's Blitz remains closed.
• World Bosses are only available on valley-3 and isles-3 due to
Star Point's recent release.• Adding Hope, Colossal, and
Phylactery to any item is currently bugged. Please do not try
and apply these enchants until it has been fixed.
&bHotfix:&r You can once again add infusions and other player-
added enchantments to your items.
&bHotfix:&r The world boss status in tab will now actually work
in shards other than valley(-1) and isles(-1)
Applied on next restart.
