&bCelestial Zenith Expansion&r
In continued celebration of Darkest Depths' 3 year anniversary,
this week we are shipping a major expansion to the Celestial
Zenith dungeon! Climb through three new ascensions with your
friends by overcoming powerful curses and mastering several new
abilities and an all-new ability reroll system. We've also added
many new builder contributed rooms, bringing the dungeon to a
total of over 100 to explore. Good luck and have fun!
&bGeneral Changes&r:
• 3 New Ascensions have been added (16, 17, and 18)
• A new reroll mechanic has been introduced: On any ability or
upgrade reward, you now have the option to reroll your options.
This is a consumable resource; all players start with 1 reroll
for the run and they can earn more or less through various
methods, such as abilities or the wheel.
• A small anti-spawner rush system has been implemented: not
killing mobs and having enemies near the exit door may prevent
you from opening the next room.
  • We believe it will be lenient enough to not affect the vast
majority of players, but if issues arise, feel free to offer
feedback in a https://discord.com/channels/313066655494438922/10

&bAbility Changes:&r
&bPrismatic&r

moving with the player. No longer slows the player or gains
duration on kill. 25 -> 20s cooldown, 5 -> 3.5s duration, +1.5
damage (6 DPS) at all rarities
• Disco Ball: Targeting angle now starts off highly focused
beneath it at first and spreads out over time. Multiple beams

0.5s at all rarities, increased stun hitbox, 4-target CDR

• Eternal Savior: Grave revive radius increased to 100% of the
heal radius instead of 50%. Nearby mobs deal 80% less damage
while you're in stasis and for 2s afterward.
• Totem of Salvation has been replaced with a new ability, Spark
of Inspiration
• Lightning Bottle: Now displays an actionbar message when
charges are gained
&bEarthbound&r
• Crushing Earth: Now hits in an AoE cone in front of you, stun
duration decreased by 0.25s at all rarities, reworked visuals
• Taunt: Passively deal bonus melee damage on crits to any mob
that is targeting you or stunned.
• Stone Skin has been replaced with a new ability, Iron Grip
&bFlamecaller&r
• Volcanic Combos: Now triggers instantly on melee attack, but
has a cooldown, similar to Arcane Strike. Reworked visuals
• Detonation: Damage reduced by 1 at all rarities
• Pyromania: Caps at 10 nearby entities on fire
&bFrostborn&r
• Frigid Combos: Now triggers instantly on melee attack, but has
a cooldown, similar to Arcane Strike. Reworked visuals

ice will rapidly replenish your absorption shield
&bShadowdancer&r

Force
&bSteelsage&r
• Sidearm: Now stores 3 charges and has a 14s cooldown,
replenishing all charges when coming off cooldown. Kills reduce
its cooldown by 3s. Damage decreased by 2 at all levels.

• Howling Winds has been replaced with a new ability,
Thundercloud Form
&bZenith Charm Changes:&r
• Improvements to the charm generation algorithm:
 • Certain stats, like Fire Duration, will no longer appear at
high rarities. Existing charms with stats at these levels will
see them downgraded, and the excess budget returned.
 • Leftover budget on a charm will now be spent on upgrading its
stats until there is none left; particularly noticeable on
single-ability charms that didn't properly use all of their
budget.
 • Your charms may have updated according to the above changes.
 • Additionally, charm stats for Totem of Salvation, Stone Skin,
Metalmancy and Howling Winds will automatically convert to stats
for the respective new abilities.
 • New charm adjectives and nouns have been added
• General charm cap reductions:
  • While zenith charms are key to becoming stronger in Zenith,
the large boost they provided scaled wildly out of hand. These
changes aim to reduce their maximum effectiveness, while
providing a noticeable difference compared to having no charms.
  • For most abilities, damage now caps at +80%, radius caps at
+50%, and cooldown caps at -30%.
  • Exact changes:
```Old values:
Cooldown: max 50%, var 6 (+/• variance), 6/10/14/18/22 (values
at Common-Legendary)
Damage: max 100%, var 10, 10/15/20/25/30
Radius: max 100% var 10, 20/30/40/50/60
New values:
Cooldown: max 30%, var 3, 5/7.5/10/12.5/15
Damage: max 80%, var 5, 10/15/20/25/30
Radius: max 50%, var 5, 10/15/20/25/30```
&bMinor New Features:&r
• Winning the Grand Prize Ticket now grants the advancements for
Liquid Courage, Intoxicating Warmth and Temporal Bender
• Shop shulkers in the market are now colored red when locked
and change back to magenta when unlocked. This may take a while
to propagate to all shops as the color change only happens when
the shop goes from unlocked -> locked.
• Restructured the hover message on chat channels to include a
description, as well as associated commands for joining and
leaving the channel.
• Added two new chat inline commands, <abilities>, which list
all selected skills and their levels, and <charms>, which lists
all equipped charms and their combined charm power usage when
hovered over.
• Cyan Tesseract can no longer be used on non-solid blocks
• Added new tooling to the task bots, including links to tasks
when searched via the bot and support for linking/posting tasks
into the related discussion space.
• Backend improvements to NetworkChat and NetworkRelay
• Hallowed Pond and Lowland Temple have been completely rebuilt!
In tandem with the new pois, the overworld surrounding them has
been redesigned to improve connectivity and meet our modern
standards.

 • Lowland Temple is now a 3 star poi
 • Earth Shrine's tree has been remade
• A new Discovery has been added to the King's Valley

• Today as all of us developers were gathering together for our
bi-weekly do-nothing conference, we noticed that a few crying
obsidians had gained sentience and were walking away past us.
Upon further inspection into the ring overworld we discovered a
few conspicuous crying-obsidian shaped holes where some of you
may remember them residing, and we promptly filled these in with
cheap plaster. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have
caused to any Monumenta explorers, lore enthusiasts,
conspirators, contemplators, philosophers, etc.
&bEnchantment Changes:&r
• Rage of the Keter : 15% -> 20% Damage for 15 seconds
• First Strike has received a minor rework. After not attacking
an enemy damaged by First Strike for 3 seconds, First Strike
will apply to the next instance of melee or projectile damage
against it.
&bItem Changes:&r
&oDeveloper Note: Many of this week's item changes address the
excessive power of Thorns stacking strategies when used in
conjunction with Cleric's Sanctified Armor. In a previous
balance update, we made the decision to buff Thorns items since
they saw minimal use. When Sanctified Armor was changed to its
current iteration, this allowed Clerics to achieve such high
survivability and high passive damage that it wasn't necessary
to actively engage in combat besides occasional spell uses.
These changes are intended to make the Thorns Cleric playstyle
less powerful but viable, and the items should still be useful
for other melee tanks such as Warrior and Warlock.&r
