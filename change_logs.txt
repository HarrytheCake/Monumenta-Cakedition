&b1.20.4 • Content Freeze&r
We are starting the process of updating Minecraft to 1.20.4. We
begin by upgrading the internal development server to 1.20.4 and
doing more intensive testing. Once we are confident that most
critical bugs are fixed, the play server will also be upgraded.
During this time, our ability to release new content will be
diminished. We won't be running weekly updates until the end of
the freeze. Critical bug fixes will still be shipped. Changes
will still occur during this time, but they will target 1.20.4
and ship after we upgrade the play server.
TL;DR: No new changes will happen for the next few weeks, then
play will be upgraded to 1.20.4 with a big changelog.
&bImportant:&r
• The player market has been locked following this week's
update. In order to unlock your shop talk to the shop shulker
and select `I want to unlock this shop`.
