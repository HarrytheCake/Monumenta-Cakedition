&bHotfix:&r Dungeon races will no longer immediately terminate
when trying to start
&bHotfix:&r Selecting the Sierhaven Quest Guide in the Knick
Knack Sack on a non-Valley shard will no longer spit an
unfunctional dialogue chain
&bHotfix:&r Selecting the New Antium Quest Guide in the Knick
Knack Sack after having completed Keeper Agents will now
properly display the quest listDaily restart has been made an
hour earlier (<t:1713589200:t>) due to DST where the server
operators live. This should help with operator availability if
something goes wrong.
&bMob Changes:&r
• Reworked DPS Cap mechanics of Vesperidys.
 • 3% Max HP / Hit -> Effectively 3% Max HP / Second
Intricacies:
• Damage Cap now increases over time up to 10% Max HP, but it
decreases whenever the boss takes damage that is over 1% of its
max health. (If you do 5% Max HP worth of damage, the Damage Cap
lowers by 4% only)
• It increases at a rate of 1% Max HP / s, but if the Damage Cap
is lower than 3% the rate doubles to 2% Max HP / s, allowing for
better sustained DPS.
• Damage Cap can never go under 1% Max HP, and never taxed,
allowing for all attacks to do at least 1% Max HP of damage.
This change hopefully allows for abilities that do a singular
big hit (e.g. Chaos Dagger) to be able to do its job better when
the Damage Cap is high, while keeping sustained DPS on the boss
similar to before.
For reference, A0's 1% is 175 HP, A15's 1% is 306.25 HP.

some new objects, called Discoveries. Punch these Discoveries to
collect them and get various small rewards!
• In the future, depending on how well this system performs, we
may expand Discoveries to further reaches of the overworlds or
other pieces of content.
• The Bestiary mob entries unlocked from interacting with NPCs
(ex: Stoneborn Immortal in the Black Willows) have been updated
to use the Discoveries system. It's recommended to those who've

unlock them again.
