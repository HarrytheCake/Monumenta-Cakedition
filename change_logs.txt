&bHotfix&r (pending next restart):
The disconnection issue regarding the P-Zero minigame has been
"fixed". Unfortunately this means that there won't be a side
scoreboard with real-time rankings anymore (which was causing
the issue to begin with), but you'll be able to see your own
position on your action bar.The above hotfix should actually be
live now. Sorry for the inconvenience.The Gallery of Fear map
&bSanguine Halls&r has been closed due to a gamebreaking
exploit. Marina Noir remains open and playable.Kaul, Eldrask,
and Hekawt can now only be summoned on valley-3 and isles-3
respectively in preparation for Star Point release
