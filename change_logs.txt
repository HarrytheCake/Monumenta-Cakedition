players

high rarities. Existing charms with these stats will keep them,
but future charms from now on will not.
  • Leftover budget on a charm will now be spent on upgrading
its stats until there is none left; particularly noticeable on
single-ability charms that didn't properly use all of their
budget.

and Howling Winds will automatically convert to stats for the
respective new abilities.
